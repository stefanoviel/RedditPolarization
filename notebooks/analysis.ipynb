The only time I felt a Pokémon was alive was when I was either doing my first play through of a game or watching the TV show.\n",

      "\n",
      "Quick review/first impressions: This is the quiet qwerty version, from the PVT (production validation testing) run. The build quality is super high and everything from the angled stands to the keyswitches themselves feel awesome. I have tried it with both flat and angled connector bars; the flat one felt better because the angle has a little \"give\" to it when you type. But ultimately I needed wider separation between the halves so the angled stands and short connector cable gave me the best ergonomics. They feel utterly solid and it's kind of a genius move to slant them off-axis so you can position each one where you want it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The key layout is harder to get used to than I expected. I've used a qwerty Kinesis Advantage since back when they were called \"Contour\", so having meta keys and space/bs/enter under thumb control is a no brainer for me. But my pinkies want to move to the next highest row up, especially resting on `P` instead of `;` and having `Enter` be either a leftward stretch for RH index finger or `Fn-Space` is more movement than I'd expect.  I'll probably remap the RH `Ctrl` to `Enter` and not worry about it ever again. \n",
      "\n",
      "The mouse and arrow movement is pretty excellent, with good acceleration on the mouse keys and intuitive vim-style movement on arrows, and the other `Fn` special keybindings make sense (though I haven't used number pad mode at all yet). The LED modes are beautiful and a lot of fun, especially the rainbow shift and \"trail of fire\" mode (lights up each key red/orange as you strike it and then fades out over a couple of seconds)\n",

      "From a software standpoint, I haven't yet hacked on the firmware due to needing a giant yak shave to get the arduino dev environment working on my Mac. The only changes I really want to make are key remappings and to reduce the number of LED modes to just ones I actually care about. \n",

      "Though I'm new to making keycaps, I've got a 12+ year background in woodworking, guitar luthiership, pearl inlay, and some basic metalcraft.  Every keycap I make is designed, carved, inlayed, grain sealed, finished in lacquer, wet-sanded and buffed to a high gloss 100% by hand (true); [Ron Swanson was my personal mentor](http://swansonquotes.com/wp-content/uploads/extras-canoeing-with-ron-1000x500.jpg) (somewhat less true).  Additionally, all my keycaps are securely mounted on PBT stems.  Yes, there's keycaps out there with wooden stems, but my experience in woodworking tells me PBT stems will be a much better choice for durability/longevity.  This hand-tooled approach is extremely inefficient and time consuming, but I'm doing this for fun not profit, so I don't really care.  The amount of time I invest in each keycap grossly outweighs what I would be comfortable charging for them, so all I'm really looking to get out of this is a new hobby and enough money to keep buying the materials needed to make these.  \n",

However, I have no idea if the community is interested in this kind of thing, and I also don't know what value you might place on such a keycap.  [As such, I hope you'll take this single-question survey on what value you would personally attribute to these.](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/DL3QDR5)  This particular keycap is not and never will be for sale for the sake of getting unbiased input; it serves as an example of what future Mastercraft pieces will be like, so your input won't determine the price of this particular keycap.

      "The IPMI is a management system on the motherboard and it has it's own network interface.

You have to connect to the IPMI and with your browser (or a utility) and change the IPMI network behavior from \"failover\" to \"dedicated\".\n",

      "Selftext: From what I can see this was discussed only once. But in a light of recent prelevant theories that Kylo might turn to light I think it's interesting to go back to this moment in TFA in order to see the real reason why Kylo disobeys Snoke. Snoke desire was to \"find droid if you can but destroy if you must\". Kylo ignors this direct order and refuses to even think of destroying BB-8 as an option. He wants that map and that droid. But why? If Kylo is blindley listeting to Snoke as his \"master\" (and interestingly enough Kylo never uses word \"master\" as traditional Syth would do, he uses the word \"teacher\"). I wonder sometimes if Kylo has doubts about Snoke from day one. He appears to listen to him mostly because he has no one else to listen to. (He's also a bit frustrated by the fact that Snoke does not understand him. When he could not get map out of Ray he looked for guideance but he got nothing but frustration from Snoke. In other words Snoke is not teaching him the way he needed to be thought. I wonder if Kylo senses that Snoke is not the answer even in TFA. He's looking for alternatives and answers. Goes as far as talking to vader helmet but helmet is just that : helmet . There is no alternative \"teacher\" that he needs. Is this the reason why Kylo really looks for Luke? As his attempt to find \"right teacher\" and are these the signs (and early proof if you want) that Kylo will turn to light? Yes Kylo kills his dad but that's only because he's trying to meet expectations of \"alternative dad\" (Snoke) and not because he's trully dark.

Snoke became like a father figure that he never had (because Han had better things to do : like smuggling some odd creatures and pissing off galaxy mob in the process). But there was always the problem : Snoke was not the answer for Kylo. He knows it, he senses it but sees no alternative.\n",

And he's encounter with his mom will be a final straw for him to turn against the Snoke. And presto : we're watching 3 on 1 scene : Kylo vs Snoke guards. It will get enternatining as guards are not easy to kill. But Kylo will get it done. After all almost nothing in this universe can really stop pissed off dark force user who just figured out that he's been played all these years by some ugly gold color coat wearing old fart. EDIT : I'll take a freedom to speculate that he'll encounter his mom dying on a bed. And yes, he'll blame snoke for her death. When she dies... o boy , o boy ... will Kylo be pissed at Snoke.\n",

      "Selftext: [Idea taken from this post about understanding Jungling](https://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/6njb7s/you_need_to_understand_jungling_before_you_flame/)\n",
      "\n",
      "I also feel that if a player wants to main ADC or support that they should put some time into playing the role they will have to perform beside in order to have a successful game. There have been too many games where bot lane turns into a flame game because the ADC thinks the support is crap and they're losing or support says ADC is crap and doesn't follow up.\n",
      "\n",
      "This lane is an ebb and flow between 4 players with potentially massive differences in strength and scaling. This lane allows for a weak ADC to get through unscathed if a beastly Brand support destroys the enemy. Alternatively 2 passive champions might switch on at level 6 and all of a sudden become the bullies.\n",
      "\n",
      "In my opinion bot lane can have the biggest differences from a successful lane and a disaster of a lane. A lead in bot lane means 2 potentially snowballing players who have 8 spells at their disposal to catch and nuke their enemy laner or laners.\n",
      "\n",
      "A lane turning into disaster is usually from people who do not match each others laning intentions or recognize what their partner is looking to do. An aggressive ADC when support is backing off can mean a free pick while a support who moves up too far while ADC is simply farming can also mean free kill or 70-80% chunk to their hp and losing lane pressure.\n",
      "\n",
      "I feel that either person in each role can learn alot about their lane by playing the other role. It will help teach yourself what the other person might be thinking and how you could play off of them and their aggression or defensive behavior. \n",
      "\n",
      ":edit: I'm simply referring to knowing how to better follow up or set up engage based on information gained playing the other role. A person playing badly is always going to happen and knowing the role better than they seem to do wont make the lane easier but if you pair up with someone competent then you can turn the 50/50 games into wins.\n",

      "\n",
      "Q2 feels really hard to hit on a priority target, especially against anyone with even a hint of mobility or CC. It's so easy to be instantly CC'd after you E'd and Q1'd in, or for the enemy to dash or flash, even when inside your ult, to delay through that small window you have for proccing the Q2. And if you don't get your true damage out, your damage is so incredibly reduced that the enemy carry may just delete you before you get another rotation of Q's or E's to escape, off.\n",
      "\n",
      "And that's the second issue, that you really have no way out for several seconds when you go in. Most other champs have their big nuke in their Ult that they either can't miss or can miss from range, discouraging going in. Or they have their mobility spells on a short cooldown to escape. But with Camille you can never be 100% you get your damage off nor that you can get out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course, at the same time, having one of the most powerful single target nukes in the game on a few second cooldown is incredibly powerful. As is the huge range mobility ability with a stun attached. Clearly rewarding good mechanics and game sense. Hence the huge mastering curve.\n",

      "Selftext: I feel like i don't appreciate this safe lane/off lane change like i should.. A lot of people like it, but to me it just seems frustrating to be in the offlane, fighting 2v1 in a literal uphill battle, and boring to be in the safelane, being able to farm and harass easily without the real threat of your farm being denied. \n",

      "Ill use League of Legends as an example, where you usually have the same number of people in a lane: one tank/bruiser in top (left), and an adc and support on bottom (right). This meta is my favorite because **everyone fights their rival** and there's meaningful, competition-based interactions between adc and adc, support and support, etc. This makes laning phase a struggle for dominance in every lane, carrying into late game where the winners or each lane have an advantage. \n",
      "\n",
      "You cant do this with safe lane because you are set to win. And i know that there's the whole exp advantage in offlane, but the difference evens out soon after laning,  and more often than not you end up with a cocky adc who dies within the first couple seconds of a team fight because during the whole laning  phase he/she has been able to overextend without consequence. And you really cant blame them, because that's how their lane is set up to be; instead of it being a fight over who's the best adc/tank/mage, its a guaranteed loss/win, the only variable being how good the jungler is.\n",
      "\n",
      "The thing i miss the most about mirror lanes is the feeling of \"fuck yeah i smashed my lane I'm the ALPHA-CARRYYY\" or when you still dominate late game after getting stomped on in lane line \"heh fuck you I've been waiting to get you back since early game.\" Its the built up rivalry throughout the whole game that i miss.\n",

For example, a method, which is ~1100 lines, declares an object at the top and mutates it throughout the method before doing something with it at the end. Not only its BS but so difficult to understand, read and debug. \n",

      "Similarly, I feel like (based on my limited knowledge of a single persons comment on twitch) the mindset of \"real men do everything in code\" is outdated, and my reason for that is because yes, you could do everything in code, by then you're not using the tools available to you that are made specifically to speed up your workflow and make it easier.\n",

      "Selftext: Probably an unpopular opinion, but hear me out. I love what Babel allows us to do on the client side. But with the advancements we've seen in Node up to v8, things like async/await and native promises being available, I find the only thing I'm missing out on is ES6 module import /export syntax. There are other things probably, but nothing I'm really missing. \n",
      "\n",
      "I don't find it to be too bad of a tradeoff to lose out on that in order to avoid the build configuration that I need to fit my workflow. I need to use babel-node to run the code in development. Fine, that's not so bad. But then I need to build a production Docker image, and in order to do that without including Dev dependencies in the image, I would have to configure a second Docker image -- a builder image. It's taking me into configuration hell, so I usually just decide to suck it up and write require instead of import. \n",

      "I received a phone call from the store on Sunday July 9th to schedule delivery.  I informed them that we already scheduled the delivery for Wednesday July 12.  I was told that my sales agent never entered that date in the system and that Wednesday July 12 is no longer available.  I accepted a Friday July 14 delivery date.  Irritating, but no big deal.\n",
      "\n",
      "We didn’t receive another phone call from anyone regarding delivery time, but we looked online and found the delivery time frame to be between 12 and 5.  I took a half day off work to stay home for the delivery.\n",
      "\n",
      "By 4:50 on Friday July 15, we still hadn’t received a call or any information about our delivery.  So we called and discovered that the delivery driver was coming, but was running late.  They didn’t arrive until 5:20.  After all the furniture parts and mattresses were brought into the house, the delivery driver tells us that all of the hardware is missing.  We were told that they will request new hardware to be mailed to us, and that once we get the hardware, they will come back and assemble the bed.  Later that evening, we received a phone call from Customer Service to see how delivery went, and explained at that time the situation with the missing hardware.  We were told to expect shipment of new hardware in 3 to 5 business days. \n",
      "\n",
      "3 business days later on Wedensday, July 19, we still hadn’t received the hardware, nor had we been notified that a shipment is on the way.  That afternoon, we called Customer Service only to be told that as far as they can tell, no shipment had gone out.  We were told that the hardware would be overnighted to us, and that we should receive the package the following day.  We explained over the phone the importance of having the bed assembled by Saturday due to guests coming.  We were assured that once we had the hardware in hand, we could call back and have same day assembly scheduled.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thursday July 20 we receive an email confirming that the overnight shipment had just left, and to expect the delivery by a major parcel service on Friday July 21.  So again, we were lied to.  We called customer service and explained that major parcel service company delivers to us very late in the evening, often as late as 8 PM, and that if that is the case, we would miss our chance to call back and have same day delivery.  We explained that we 100% needed the assembly done on Saturday and attempted to schedule the assembly.  We were told that assembly could not be scheduled until we had the hardware in hand.  BUT, we were assured that if we called back first thing Saturday morning, it would be no problem to get same day assembly.  On Friday July 21, around 8:15 PM, we received the hardware.\n",
      "\n",
      "Saturday morning July 22, at exactly 8 AM, we called customer service to request same day assembly.  We were told that an email needed to be sent to the service department and that we’d get a call back once they had a scheduled time.  Based on the tone of the conversation, we were expecting a quick response.  Around 10:30, we still didn’t have a call back, so we called again.  This time we were told the very same thing – the agent would need to contact the service department by email, and we would get a call back once a time is scheduled.  By 1, we still hadn’t heard back.  We knew that our chances of getting that same day assembly were dimming, so we called back.  We were told that the reason we hadn’t received a phone call yet is that so far there had been no response from the service department regarding when they could come out and assemble our bed.  20 minutes or so after that phone call, we received a call checking in and were told that there was no available service technicians to come out, but that there were several delivery drivers in the area, and one of them would come out and do the assembly.  We were told to just hang tight and wait on a phone call to let us know what time.\n",
      "\n",
      "We got that phone call around 3:30, and the response wasn’t good.  We were not going to get the bed assembled that day, and in fact, it would be Tuesday before anyone could come out.  We were told our delivery fee would get refunded (we paid that in cash), and basically sorry about your troubles.  We ended up going out and purchasing a hide away guest bed for $185 just so our guest would have a bed to sleep in. \n",
      "\n",
      "On Monday, July 24, we attempted to get the approximate time that the service technician would come out on Tuesday by contacting customer service through chat.  We were told that unfortunately no time could be given other than between 8 AM and 10 PM because this was a rush assembly, and not a scheduled time.  We confirmed that although they couldn't give us an exact time, we were in fact scheduled for an assembly on Tuesday.  The answer was simply \"Correct.\" So again I took a day off work to wait on a service technician.  They gave us such a wide range of time, that we simply waited and waited.  at 6 PM, we decided to call the store to vent our frustrations that we are still here waiting on an assembly.  We were told by the manager that \"if it hasn't happened yet, you're not getting an assembly done today, because the latest they work is 5 PM.\"  The store manager called customer service on our behalf.  About an hour later, we got a call back saying that we were never told Tuesday, but instead told \"Tuesday or Wednesday\" and that in fact it would be Wednesday morning before the technician was in our area to assemble the bed.  Because of the lies and half-truths we’ve been told throughout this ordeal, we're in doubt that anyone is coming this morning. \n",
      "\n",
      "Overall we’ve had a good shopping experience and have had good luck with our purchases.  But this last purchase has really soured us on them.  We sent a detailed complaint yesterday in an email to them that very much mirrors this post.  So far no response, and so far no appearance of our Wednesday morning service technician.  Here's hoping someone arrives by noon.\n",
      "\n",
      "*UPDATE*\n",
      "SO no one came this morning. We called at 11, someone was to call us back. That didn't happen. We called at 1, didn't get a call back until 3, and we were told someone would be here between 4 and 5. By 5, no one had showed. Finally someone showed at 5:40. During the bed assembly he came back out and said \"you're not going to like this. There are still some parts missing.\" We were missing two legs, two posts, and the trundle wasn't sliding properly. They offered to either mail us the parts and schedule another service, or a full return and replacement on Friday. We took the latter. Someone is supposed to call us tomorrow and give us our delivery time. Not holding my breath. Throughout all this, we haven't had a single \"smooth things over\" conversation with a manager or any higher-ups. No one seems to care whether we are happy or not, or whether we will shop there again or not.  \n",

      "Selftext: Okay, so I'm going to break from my usual pattern of doing a direct link post since Reddit always complains that I'm submitting the same link. If you want to read the update on Indiegogo, you can find it [here](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/corona-blossom-a-visual-novel-by-frontwing/x/14852690#/updates).\n",

      "&gt; ##Shipping update\n",
      "&gt;\n",
      "&gt;It took an extra day, but we headed to the warehouse.\n",
      "&gt;\n",
      "&gt;We had all Corona Blossom-related items brought down and gathered for us.\n",
      "&gt;\n",
      "&gt;We searched through everything.\n",
      "&gt;\n",
      "&gt;We asked multiple people.\n",
      "&gt;\n",
      "&gt;We found none of the items that were supposed to be transferred last week - the artbooks, happi coats, hoodies, and English DVD jackets.\n",
      "&gt;\n",
      "&gt;We're looking into what has happened to these items, and will either find them or have them made again.\n",
      "&gt;\n",
      "&gt;In the meantime, though, this is what we're going to do:\n",
      "&gt;\n",
      "&gt;The shipping boxes are ready to be transferred, and we'll have that done tomorrow. They will arrive to our shipping provider by Friday. We are going to say forget about the English DVD jackets for the time being and have them ship everything that's shippable at this point. This means anyone whose reward does not contain the artbook, happi coat, hoodie, or mousepad. (The mousepads are on their way from China by boat because Chinese customs has apparently put a block on exporting adult goods by air.) This comes out to only about 75 packages, but it's the best thing we can do at this point. We really should have done this weeks ago, but we constantly thought and hoped a full resolution was right around the corner, and so kept holding off.\n",
      "&gt;\n",
      "&gt;Those 75 people will get their English DVD jacket together with either their Vol.2&amp;3 rewards or their apology gift if they didn't pledge for Vol.2 or 3.\n",
      "&gt;\n",
      "&gt;Also, we're currently preparing a supplementary apology gift to go out to everyone who backed any of the campaigns, which will also be included with either Vol.2&amp;3 rewards or your apology button set (as it still has to be produced). We'll announce what it is once we have final confirmation.\n",

The [last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/6p9nhe/the_state_of_fashion_london/) gave me a bunch of suggestions for new areas, so I now have a fairly long list of regions to post. Look for a new SoF post every few days or so, and hopefully, this becomes a recurring series.\n",

      "As we've done before, if you live in the area and/or feel you know fashion, comment about your opinion on the local state/form of fashion, hopefully inciting a good discussion that I'll write up into a little summary referencing the most comprehensive comments a day after this post is up.\n",
      "If you have any suggestions for future posts, feel free to either comment or shoot me a PM. \n",

      "**EDIT** \n",
      "So Montreal is extremely diverse, with a number of influences - it is European, but also North American. Here are a few comments that sum this all up nicely.\n",
      "\n",
      "From u/Vira90\n",
      "\n",
      "&gt;This city is definitely style conscious, especially for women, but men here tend to be more fashion forward than other cities as well. Montreal varies very significantly in style, but there is a common trait that unites Montrealers. It's a city that accepts and encourages individuality, and that is often expressed through clothing.\n",
      "The punk/street wear vibe can be felt in younger areas, such as the Plateau or Rosemont region, but if you make your way downtown, the aesthetic is much more polished. Near the \"financial district\" downtown, you'll find men clad in suits and women in form fitting skirts and blouses. Near the McGill/Concordia area, you'll find students in their university colours or in preppy chino/polo attire. One thing that is a constant is personal expression. From the guy working at Manulife Financial, to the hipster/trendy-obsessed barista in the Plateau, many Montrealers try and showcase their individuality.\n",
      "It's a city that definitely has a European flair, but also seems to attract a grimy aesthetic you could find in San Francisco 20 years ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "From u/XavierWT\n",
      "\n",
      "&gt;1) Business wear is dressed way way way down if you compare to New York or London. Even what is seen as business formal is pretty casual.\n",
      "2) A lot of people have tattoos. Moreso than in other large cities I visited.\n",
      "3) There is a tremendous amount of subcultures with their own quirks and styles, so it's hard to generalize\n",
      "4) Campus culture : With 4 Universities (+ if you cound ÉTS and Polythechnique as separate) you will find a truckton of college campuses. Sweatpants-all-the-time is not as prevalent as elsewhere though, but college students will look like college students.\n",
      "\n",
      "From u/maasturbator\n",
      "\n",
      "&gt; the best way to describe it is laid back. People don't do over the top fine dining just like people don't really do over the top haute-couture.\n",
      "Style is wide ranging but it takes a page out of french fashion, regardless of the style it should always look effortless and that you didn't spend more than 5 minutes getting dressed. In that sense things like pocket squares and quirky accessories aren't very common.\n",
      "Fashion also tends to shine during the fall, when you have the opportunity to wear layers and show your style. During summer months everyone's down to basics to stay cool and during the winter everyone's covered up in parkas.\n",
      "\n",
      "From u/Underrepair\n",
      "\n",
      "&gt;Montreal is very heterogeneous; it's actually quite hard to put everyone in the same basket\n",
      "\n",
      "Yeah, I know I basically listed every comment, but they're all worthy. If this thread garners more replies in the future, I'll leave them down there. \n",

      "Long-time lurker, first time poster. As someone that prefers to read makeup subs and watch smaller youtubers, I've been noticing more and more discussion and exasperation with the warm-toned palettes despite their popularity, and a wish for cool-toned palettes to become the new popular item. Furthermore, whenever people on subs make recommendations about cool toned palettes currently on the market, there is always a barrage of people commenting as to why such-and-such palette isn't truly cool-toned. Which got me thinking...what does a \"true\" cool-toned palette actually mean? Because I thought I understood the color concept until reading the ABH subculture thread here. Is it just 50 shades of gray (no reference intended)? Can someone potentially post an example using shadow singles? And furthermore, does anyone think that truly cool toned palettes aren't becoming as popular/produced because those colors might only be flattering on a limited portion of skin tones? \n",

All in all I think Chicken Wings was a good game and Bshar and Sympton ruined the game.  I unlike the others here have actually gone through the trouble of contacting help.theculling.com, and they basically told me my ban as well as any ban is permanent.  When I asked MSK or Sympton, or Bshar about my bans length rather than tell me I was perma'd they all had to tell me to contact help.theculling.com.  This is such a scummy and underhanded tactic only designed to waste my time. I don't know why they wouldn't simply tell me I was perma'd in PMs, considering it's probably BShar who runs the help.theculling.com email.  This is disgusting and should absolutely be rectified by CEO if he wants his game to live on, ON PC.  Thank you, praise jesus, and get some chicken wings.\n",

      "Selftext: Hello everyone :) I am new to Reddit and new to talking about my HS. I was diagnosed when I was 14 and had my first of three related surgeries a week right after. I was send to the dermatologist for an emergency appointment when I was a teen because the abscess in my underarm area had become horrible infected. I was lucky to be diagnosed correctly the first time, I know people struggle for years with this without proper diagnosis. I'm pretty sure I had been struggling with HS for a year prior to this however, every time I brought it up to my mother a fight would break out. She would tell me that I'm disgusting, that I got my \"pimples\" because I didn't shower or have proper hygiene, as a result I would just not tell her and wait for them to disappear. This was the worst thing I could have done. I was so ashamed to talk to my mom or doctor about it that I let my HS progress to the point that the infection was spreading and I was physically ill from it. Oral antibiotics were no longer working and I had to be placed on IV antibiotics so the infection could die down before I had my first HS surgery. Unfortunately for me, my dermatologist could not perform my surgery and another doctor performed it. I learned a week later that this surgeon has a horrible track record with post-op patients getting infections due to early discharge and improper post-op treatment. I was once again in the hospital for the same infection, but now post-op and with an open wound. After another week on IV antibiotics I had my second surgery. I was on IV antibiotics twice a day for three weeks on December 2008. On February 2009 I had surgery on my other side for HS once again, not as dramatic this time, but still missed two weeks of school.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fast forward now I'm 22 going on 23 I still struggle with HS but nowhere near as bad. I get abscesses behind my ears, groin and under breast. It's hard not feeling comfortable wearing sleeveless shirts or dresses, specially in South Texas where 90-100F weather year around is the norm. My mother and I do not talk about my HS, she still insists that it's my lack of hygiene, which triggers me. My bf of 9 years and I do not talk about it either, he however does know I have a skin condition that causes me to have abscesses. Him and I were already dating when I had surgery but I didn't tell him the whole story about my HS. He's very understanding and tries his best to be supportive. I've recently started to get abscesses pretty bad in my groin area. This is specially stressful as my bf and I are older, going to get married in May 2018 and hoping to start a family. I'm scared to get pregnant and have my HS act up. I stay awake a lot thing about this. I would love to hear about how your guys deal with HS, specially from any mothers or mothers to be.

And, as you can guess from the title, it was a colossal failure. We were constantly trying to play \"scrims\" but over 6 or so weeks, we never actually got to play a real game. Thinking back, it might've been off-season, but still, it was a little discouraging never being able to play a single match. I also can't remember if this was an iron or bronze league\n",

      "Selftext: Regarding mixin selection, since 75% of all mixins are just randomly chosen (IIRC 25% are from the last five days and the rest are just randomly selected, correct me if I'm wrong), doesn't that mean that, going forward, Monero mixins will become less and less believable as time goes on? For example, five or ten years from now, you could have wallets choosing mixins that are five or ten years old, and thus are unlikely to be the actual payment (sure, someone *could* spend some Monero that have been gathering dust in a wallet for half a decade, but it's unlikely), allowing an adversary to guesstimate which of the inputs is the real one and reducing Monero's anonymity.\n",
      "\n",
      "It would be possible for a wallet to choose one mixin that is recent and three that are five years old (if the selection for the other 75% of mixins is actually random, the average age of mixins ten years from now would be five years, no?), reducing the probable anonymity set in that transaction to two (the two recent inputs) for a hypothetical transaction where a user spends Monero shortly after receiving it ten years from now. Is this an actual issue, and if so, what could be done about it?\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, how will Monero handle quantum cryptanalysis? I know quantum computers capable of running Shor's algorithm against a reasonably large key size may be a long ways off, but if some malicious actor did develop such machines, they could deanonymize transactions made at any time in the past, as the blockchain is permanent. So unlike the concern of a quantum computer wielding adversary stealing current coins, which only poses a threat to current users and therefore can be ignored for the time being so long as quantum computers are assumed to be 5+ years away, a quantum computer wielding adversary with the goal of deanonymizing Monero could use the blockchain to deanonymize transactions indefinitely far in the past, so it doesn't matter if Monero updates at some future date to use post quantum cryptography -- transactions made *now* will be vulnerable forever, so long as someone maintains records of them. So if Monero's anonymity is quantum vulnerable, shouldn't steps be taken to fix this vulnerability *now?*\n",

The model makes them look deformed. Second off they should actually start watching games and not give the model to players who dont remotely need it. What made them give that model to hayward?

      "\n",
      "We've seen many different versions of it this season. We have rotated through 7 different starters, and with a variety of different rotations with injuries and bullpen stints mixed in for some of the starters. Lot of questions have been raised, especially with the trade deadline approaching in a week, of what we should be doing with our rotation. My post today will be going through and evaluating our 7 starters to see what our best rotation going forward should be.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Before you go and view these, you guys must understand some things about the spreadsheet first. It can only be viewed completely in its entirety through Excel; you have to download it through one of these two links and open it up in Excel to view the whole thing. The reason why is that I used a complex Excel checking box option that is not supported byGoogle Drive or dropbox. I will explain more in the next paragraph what this exactly means for this piece. If you cannot download it (please let me know) or you do not have Excel, you will still be able to understand this as I write it. You will just not be able to play around with the spreadsheet (Again, I'll explain that below).\n",
      "\n",
      "For this piece, I set out to evaluate our pitchers against a set of statistical measures. Probably around half of them I am sure all of you are familiar with or can recognize. The other half, not so much. There are 14 criteria in total I used for this post, and I ranked our 7 pitchers 1-7 on best to worst for each of those criteria of our pitching staff; 1 being best, 7 being worst. For those that have the Excel Spreadsheet, you will notice 2 sheets in the spreadsheet. One is titled \"Statistical Data\" which contains all the hard data. The other is titled \"Rankings\" where it shows all the rankings for each category and each pitcher. A total column is on the far right that has a total of the ranking values. Now, I had mentioned a \"complex checking box option\" earlier in this post, which you will be able to see in the B column in the \"Rankings\" page. For those of you that have that, you are able to select which categories you would like to evaluate our pitching staff by. It's weird, and I'm trying it out, but I thought having an interactive post you guys could look at would be kind of neat to try out.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, if you believe that K%, GB%, and SoftContact% are the three most important elements for a Rockies pitcher, you will check those three boxes, leave the others unchecked, and to the right of those boxes, you will be given a 5 player starting rotation of Tyler Anderson, Tyler Chatwood, Kyle Freeland, Jon Gray, and Antonio Senzatela. I hope you guys like this or find it interesting. I honestly have no idea what the feedback is gonna be. For those of you that don't have excel or are unable to download it, I'm really sorry I couldn't get it to work as of right now.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the rest of this piece I will be going through this post as if I was evaluating all 14 criteria for all pitchers. I will go through now and list out the 14 criteria I chose and what they are or why they are important for Rockies pitchers (especially at Coors).\n",
      "\n",
      "**SwStr%** - Swings and misses out of total pitches. Obviously, as a pitcher, you want every pitch to be a swing and miss. The less contact that is made and the more outs produced, the better. Swings and misses are a big part of that, and fundamental to strikeouts.\n",
      "\n",
      "**F-Strike%** - The amount of first pitch strikes per plate appearance. Pretty self explanatory, but the sooner you can get ahead in the count as a pitcher, the better.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Z-Contact%** - Percentage of swings on pitches inside the zone in which contact was made. Similar to SwStr%, but strictly for inside the zone. It can be easier to make someone miss on a pitch if they chase, but if they are missing on pitches in the strikezone, you are doing something right. Z-Contact% includes foul balls.\n",
      "\n",
      "**xFIP** - Estimated run prevention independent of the performance of the defense. Only includes walks, K's, HBP, and HR's. FIP formula is (13*HR + 3*[BB+HBP] - 2*K)/IP . Difference between FIP and xFIP is that xFIP replaces HR with the league average home run rate multiplied by pitcher's fly ball rate.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Home FIP** - Because FIP punishes you for home runs allowed, and Coors is HR friendly, having a low home FIP is probably more desirable since we need consistent pitching at Coors.\n",
      "\n",
      "**SIERA** - Called an ERA predictor, and doesn't ignore balls in play like FIP and xFIP do. Estimates what an ERA could be based off of previous play, but does not project future play.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Soft%** - Percentage of balls put in play that are considered soft contact. Very important for pitchers that balls put in play are as close to soft contact as possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "**GB%** - Percentage of balls put in play that are groundballs. Very important, especially at Coors, where you want the ball out of the air as much as possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "**HR/FB%** - Percentage of flyballs that are home runs. League average is around 10-11% I believe.\n",
      "\n",
      "**K%** - Percentage of plate appearances that end in a strikeout. The higher, the better.\n",
      "\n",
      "**BB%** - The percentage of plate appearances that end in a walk. The lower, the better.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Home OBP** - On base percentage has a high correlation to run production for teams. If you are successfully able to keep players off the bases, you are giving yourself a great opportunity for a win. Can be especially hard for some pitchers at Coors.\n",
      "\n",
      "**OPS w/RISP** - How is the opposing team hitting against our pitcher when there are runners in scoring position? OPS is SLG + OBP, and is used as a indicator for batting productivity. The lower it is, the better, especially with runners in scoring position.\n",
      "\n",
      "**OBP 1st/Lineup** - Opposing teams on base percentage the first time they face our pitcher through their lineup. With our bullpen being a weakpoint, it is extremely important our starters can make good starts. If you can make it the first two or three innings with limiting base runners, that's a great place to start.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before I move on, I wanted to explain really quickly why I chose these specific criteria for this analysis. I have a couple criteria that are focused on performance at home. I am a strong believer in that if you can pitch well at Coors, you can probably pitch even better away from Coors. Plus, our pitching staff needs consistency for pitching at Coors if we were to continue to stay in the playoff hunt. I'm also not saying by any means that these are the best. For example, SIERA kinda feels like the odd man out from all these statistics. But I wanted a little of everything when looking at these evaluations.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Results**\n",
      "\n",
      "I won't post a table here for the results just because of time because I work in the morning, and everyone should be able to have them available to you by clicking one of the links. After performing the rankings for all 7 pitchers, we are given a starting rotation of Tyler Anderson, German Marquez, Jon Gray, Jeff Hoffman, and Antonio Senzatela - with Kyle Freeland and Tyler Chatwood left out. Now while Chatwood is out by a pretty significant margin (WOO!), Freeland Senzatela and Hoffman are only separated by a total of 3 points. Now considering that Freeman's game from 7/23 isn't included in this because FanGraphs doesn't update for a while (and this is where I get all my stats for these posts), Senzatela has been used for bullpen action, and Hoffman has struggled mightily at home, it's a tossup between all three for the final two spots.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some of you might actually be really surprised to see Tyler Anderson rated so highly by this simulation and maybe even Marquez too (not if you've seen him pitch recently 9 K's last start WOOOOO). Anderson ranks 1st in the team for 1st strike percentage and K%, which are all good things pitchers should be doing. I'm interested if in seeing this people would be interested in seeing him crack the rotation again.\n",

      "This wasn't so much an informative post as some of you may be expecting, but rather a project I'd like to continue. I take your feedback seriously with all my posts that I do; not only because they take a lot of time and energy, but because you guys usually have good stuff to say. And I'm usually I'm an asshole who doesn't know how to take good criticism so I'm taking in it stride. Again, my criteria are not the best. I will not say they are even close. I would ideally like this spreadsheet to be something that you guys, the community can put input into and I can update it as so. Maybe you guys feel like xFIP can suck it, and there is another measure you would like to see added? Or maybe we can just keep adding to it? Then I can update the spreadsheet every rotation flip or week and make a weekly post about it. I don't know. Again, this whole post is kinda weird so bear with me.\n",

When they warred, she wept. When natural disasters befell them, she wept. \n",

      "It was especially grievous to see the humans turn on one another as they changed. All it took was a bite and two hours later, the victim would awake to be just like its attacker – mindless and hungry for flesh. She needed a way to destroy the undead before they corrupted the rest of precious humankind. \n",

      "Nelly was preparing dinner when she spotted her blender in the cupboard, one of the humans’ inventions. A few months ago, she had seen a little human-woman using it to blend fruit. Nelly had been so excited that she ordered Corfus to make her one. Her version was huge by Earth’s standards; it was about the height of ten human men. The blender jar was affixed to a glossy red base with crudely-formed dials. The word “VYTAMEEX” was scrawled in childish handwriting across the side. Corfus was always bad at spelling. \n",

      "Nelly pondered, inspecting the blender’s sharp blades. What if she used it to destroy the undead? She could pulverise multiple of those horrid creatures at once! She thought it a fantastic idea. Later that night, grasping the blender and a sack of Sky Dust, Nelly leapt over the edge of the cloud-lair.\n",
      "\n",
      "The situation on Earth was more horrible than she had anticipated. The undead were smelly. When she chucked tens of undead beings, each of them pinky-sized, into the blender and gave it a whir, the fetid stench became unbearably pronounced. Nelly felt nauseous, but not as nauseous as when her giant form accidentally knocked over a building full of healthy people. A sense of hopelessness overwhelmed her as she attempted to cope with the onslaught. Tirelessly, she crossed from city to city, country to country, repeatedly filling and emptying her blender of putrid, swamp-coloured gunk.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nelly grew exhausted. She needed Corfus’ help. Using her mighty legs, she sprung back to the cloud-lair. Sinking down into her sofa, she wiped the sweat from her brow. She had done all she could. Alas, she paid no attention to the tiny teeth-marks on her bare feet, little pin-prick injuries she thought would do no harm.\n",

      "\n",
      "In this archetype the hero begins the story on the side of an evil or oppressive force. Though they are fighting for the “bad guys” they do so through innocence and ignorance or because they, at the time, believe they are on the side of right. At some point in the story they face one or more moral crises that reveal to them that the side they are fighting for doesn’t align with their own sense of right and wrong. At this point the hero abandons their allegiance to their compatriots. At some point the hero then defects to the enemy of their former allies. This can happen immediately or there can be a period between their initial rejection of their own people and their defection where they are either on the run or on their own and aimless. After their defection there may be a proving period where their new allies haven’t fully accepted them yet and they have to prove themselves. Ultimately, the hero ends up taking on a leadership position among their new found allies and then leads the fight against their former masters.\n",

      "Examples in Pop Culture: Jake Sully in Avatar, Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise’s character) in the Last Samurai, more loosely Marko Ramius (Sean Connery’s character) in Hunt for Red October, and (though the story is structured a bit differently) Jason Bourne in the Bourne Identity\n",
      "\n",
      "Finn had his moral crisis at the Jakku village where he refused to kill the captive villagers. After that he abandoned his position as a Stormtrooper and went on the run. He stopped running and was willing to turn and fight when Rey was taken prisoner but we haven’t seen Finn fully throw in his lot with the Resistance yet. He provided them with vital intel and helped take down the shields and the oscillator on Starkiller base but his primary goal was to rescue Rey, not fight the First Order. Following the archetype forward we can expect that Finn will join the Resistance fully and become and instrumental part of their fight against the First Order. Finn’s final victory will likely come through him leading that fight in some capacity, possibly in a position similar to Han’s or Lando’s in RotJ.\n",

      "This character starts off as a good person, but as the story progresses they make progressively more morally questionable choices until they eventually become unquestionably evil. Sometimes this archetype includes a tempter that seduces the character into following that dark path such as Mephistopheles in Faust, Lord Henry in the Picture of Dorian Grey, and of course Palpatine in the Prequels.\n",

I don’t think that this will be Kylo’s archetype for the Sequel trilogy as he doesn’t really fit the start of the archetype in TFA. He’s not a good person who starts making bad choices, he’s already fully evil. One of the first things he does when he comes on scene is murder a defenseless old man and by the end of the movie he’s murdered his own father. It’s hard to get much more evil than that.\n",

I also think that either by the end of VIII or the beginning of IX he is going to realize that Han was right, Snoke is just using him. I don’t think Ben’s redemption will be like Vader’s where he went from fully evil to fully good with a single decision. I think we will see Ben wrestle with it a bit more and see a drawn out redemption arc in IX. Since Han is gone, I think Luke will be filling in the roll of the forgiving father.\n",

      "**Rey: The Heroine’s Journey**\n",
      "\n",
      "In many cultures throughout history girls were considered women as soon as they were old enough to bear children. Boys, by contrast, often had to go through a rite of passage before they were considered men. This is why hero's journey stories are ultimately stories about growing up with the quest or adventure serving as a rite of passage for the hero to become a man. Heroine's journey stories are a bit different. Girls didn’t have to do anything to earn the right to be considered women, so their stories typically aren’t entirely about the heroine growing up. Women in many societies have, however, been oppressed due to their gender. As a result heroine’s journeys are typically about breaking free of limitations and the heroine finding her place in the world. Persephone follows this archetype, though she is caught in a cycle of breaking free from Hades and being forced to return. Disney loves this archetype, it’s used in nearly every Disney Princess movie. This is why the first song the princess sings is always about her longing for a better life or about how she feels like she doesn’t fit in. Once the adventure begins the heroine begins to break free and begins to get exactly what she wants. But often the story follows Persephone’s story and there’s a catch. The catch forces the heroine to return to her initial place of limitation. Often this return comes immediately after a great victory for the heroine. (Persephone is forced to return to Hades after returning home and being reunited with her mother. Belle has to return to her “provincial life” just as she and the beast are starting to fall in love. Mulan is discovered as a woman just after she wins the battle. Anastasia finally meets her grandmother only for her grandmother not to believe her, etc.) The heroine must then break free from her limitations once more and this time she leaves the catch behind, achieves her final victory and finds her rightful place.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rey's story is about her breaking free of the limitations she has put on herself by choosing to stay on Jakku to wait for her family. She has left Jakku behind but she hasn’t thrown off her chains completely as she still, above all else, longs to be reunited with her family. If Rey’s story follows Persephone’s then she will likely be reunited with her family in TLJ. Her return to her place of limitation could either be her being forced to return to Jakku or her once again being separated from her family and having to hold faith that she would see them again. Following the archetype, this would come after she had had some sort of victory. Her return to limitation could either be a cliff hanger at the end of TLJ or it could happen at the beginning of IX. IX then would be about her breaking free once more, saving the day, and would end with her being reunited with her family, and having found her rightful place in the galaxy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Side note: Heroine’s mentors and father figures In hero’s journey stories the mentor or father figure has to die because it forces the hero to be a man and stand on their own. It also often shows the hero surpassing their mentor/father by defeating what their mentor/father could not. Mentors and parental figures in heroine's journeys play a different role than in hero's journeys. Sometimes the overly strict parent is the source of the heroine's limitations and the parent figure goes through their own character arc where they come to accept the choices that the heroine has made (Ariel’s father, Mulan’s father, Moana’s father, etc.). (They could play around with this trope with Luke not wanting to train Rey initially and then having something she does change his mind and/or by having him be overprotective of her.) In other cases the heroine's mentor or family is the belonging that she ends up finding in the end (Anastasia’s grandmother, Rapunzel’s parents). (They appear to be using this trope with Rey, as what she wants more than anything is to be reunited with her family.) Heroes have to achieve their final victories alone, but heroines’ final victories are often collaborative. The hero must be a man and stand on his own. The heroine has found her place and so stands with the friends/family she has found along the way, her mentor often included (Mushu with Mulan, Maui with Moana). (I think we’ll likely see this with Rey too. I don’t think she will go into her final battle alone like Luke did, she’ll have friends/family by her side. If nothing else, it prevents IX from being accused of being a repeat of RotJ.) Heroine's might lose their parent(s) at or before the very beginning of the story, but if the mentor or parental figure is still alive when the heroine's adventure begins then they usually make it to the end of the story. This is 50% of the reason why I don’t think Luke will die in the Sequel Trilogy. We've been straight up told by Maz that Rey's place of belonging is with Luke. He's her reward at the end of all of this. For this reason, killing Luke off makes no more sense than killing Rapunzel's parents in Tangled or killing Anastasia's grandmother in Anastasia.\n",

      "**Luke: The Messianic Hero**\n",
      "\n",
      "A Messianic Hero, as the name implies, is a character whose arc follows the life of Christ. This archetype is often used in modern fantasy in part because it works very well with the hero’s journey archetype, but not all Messianic heroes are on the hero’s journey and not all hero’s journey characters are Messianic heroes. Messianic heroes are shown to willingly sacrifice their lives to save someone else, symbolizing Christ willingly going to his death to pay for the sins of humanity. Sometimes the characters literally die and then are resurrected (Aslan in the Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, Gandalf, Harry Potter, etc.) other times the characters experience a symbolic death and resurrection (Aragorn when he takes the paths of the dead in the Return of the King). After the character’s resurrection they often disappear for a period of time (symbolizing the ascension of Christ) and their allies are shown to be waiting for their return. In the hero’s absence their allies become embroiled in a battle that seems hopeless (The battle against the forces of the White Witch in the Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, the Battle of Helm’s Deep and the Battle of the Pelennor Fields in the Lord of the Rings, the Battle of Hogwarts). This symbolizes the Battle of Armageddon. When all hope seems lost the hero returns often with an army behind him, symbolic of the second coming of Christ, the hero’s allies are saved and evil is defeated once and for all. Sometimes this archetype skips the ascension phase and goes straight from the resurrection to the second coming (Aslan, Aragorn, and Harry Potter all do this).\n",
      "Luke follows the first half of this archetype in RotJ. His attempt to redeem his father parallels the crucifixion of Christ. Both are willing to sacrifice themselves for the salvation of others, both are captured without a fight, taken before evil men, and condemned to death. Vader only achieves redemption through Luke's \"death\" when he repents of all of the evil that he had done and accepts the forgiveness offered by Luke. This parallels the teachings of the Bible that salvation is only gained through repenting of one's sins and accepting that they were paid for by the death, burial, and resurrection of Christ. (This, I think, is the symbolism that people who ask how Anakin could truly be redeemed are missing. His redemption didn't come from his good works outweighing the bad but through his repentance.) At the end, Anakin is saved and Luke returns to his friends alive.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here’s the thing about the Sequel Trilogy, I don’t think Rey is supposed to be a new Messianic hero (her arc is something different). I think it’s still supposed to be Luke. They appear to be following the next steps of the archetype very closely. Very shortly after the end of RotJ Luke disappears and by the time TFA takes place no one knows where he is. There’s the parallel to the ascension of Christ. In his absence some doubt he will ever return, some doubt if he ever existed at all, but the faithful (Leia and the Resistance) still cling to the hope that he will come back one day soon. There’s only one step of the archetype left, the second coming. I fully expect a scene, possibly in TLJ but more likely at the end of IX, where the Republic/Resistance forces have found themselves backed into a corner. At the last moment Luke will show up, possibly with allies beside him (a new order of Force users?), and we’ll get to see exactly how powerful he’s truly become.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is the other 50% of why I don’t think Luke will die in this trilogy, it breaks this archetype. Luke already had his “death”, he just came back from it.\n",

I had in fact been born and raised there. This was my first return. A reunion with the deepest well-springs of my being. Wandering about, I noticed happily that the house had been immaculately maintained. There'd been added a number of additional rooms, but in a way that blended so seamlessly with the original construction, one would never detect any difference. Returning to the house's grand foyer, there came a knock at the door. My son was standing there. He was happy and carefree, clearly living a life of deep harmony and joy. We embraced, a warm and loving embrace, nothing withheld. We were, in this moment, one. My vision ended, and I awoke with a tremendous feeling of optimism and confidence in you and your future.

      "“A wise man once told me that mystery is the most essential ingredient of life, for the following reason:  mystery creates wonder which leads to curiosity, which in turn provides the ground for our desire to understand who and what we truly are (Neil Armstrong 1969). The search for meaning at the heart of life brings us to the contemplation of an eternal enigma. Mysteries are the stories we tell ourselves to contend with life’s resistance to our longing for answers. Mysteries abound. This continent, this country, our own earthly origins are all laden with them, underlying our existence, pre-dating all our childish notions of “history.” Mythology precedes our access to historical or scientific fact, and, we know now, fulfilled much the same function for earlier civilizations – providing meaning in the face of a remorseless, indifferent universe – but in the absence of scientifically verifiable fact it is necessary to sometimes view them as one and the same.”\n",

      "\"My astonishment was complete, my sense of responsibility enormous. I bent my shoulder to this solitary task with dedication and never breathed a word to anyone about the true nature of the work, not to my superiors back at Fairfield, nor to the many friends I’d made in our new community, not even to my family. For nearly five years nothing of consequence appeared in the data I collected. An occasional anomaly surfaced, but nothing that seemed to justify the expense and effort we’d made to create the LPA in the first place. I grew discouraged, and during this time the colonel himself seemed to lose interest; he made fewer and fewer trips up the mountain. My career sank into limbo. At Fairchild, officers junior to me began receiving promotions that, given the length and quality of my service, should have gone to me. I began to wonder if I’d made the worst mistake of my life. Making colonel, something I’d felt would one day surely come my way, seemed out of reach. I struggled with despair, and buried myself deeper in what began to seem like meaningless routine. Dedication to duty, without questioning the purpose, that’s the life of an officer, I told myself. Until one morning I awoke to the realization that this compensation had distanced and alienated me from my now teenage son; during the crucial years when he most needed my support and guidance, I was hiding myself away up the mountain, working late into the night. My wife tried her best to alert me that trouble was brewing for Robert, but still I made excuses--he was a good student, quarterback of the football team—and refused to see what was right in front of my eyes. It took an unspeakable tragedy to return me to my senses. The murder of Laura Palmer, my son’s girlfriend at the time, changed everything. At first, when suspicions swirled around Robert, the guilt and responsibility I felt for the years I’d neglected him brought me to the edge of an abyss. Although he was cleared, our relief was short-lived as we came to realize Robert had drifted into recreational drug use and interactions with the local criminal element. Our son had become a stranger to us, and his future, his very life was imperiled. My wife and I felt more powerless and afraid than at any time in our life together. The appearance of an unexpected ally provided help unlooked for: FBI Special Agent Dale Cooper arrived to investigate Laura’s death; a stalwart, trustworthy man, stout of character, foursquare in thought and nature. Although he remained focused on solving that horrific crime, I soon realized that the scope of Cooper’s interest in what had happened to our community encompassed a much broader field. Colonel Milford confided in me that Cooper’s presence here--and his association with secret allies of the colonel’s--signaled a raising of the ante of our stated mission. Our zone had suddenly gone hot; the data I was monitoring went from zero to sixty. Strange phenomena--of the sort frequently encountered by the colonel throughout his life--cropped up with regularity, registering seismically on my instrumentation. From the start, Cooper himself experienced turbulent phenomena: sightings in the woods, mysterious encounters, troubling dreams. A wave of darkness that threatened to engulf us had awoken. My labors became animated with newfound purpose; perhaps, at last, the answers we’d come looking for were within reach. Suffice it to say that, in the conventional sense, Cooper “solved” the crime; Laura had been killed by her own father, Leland Palmer. Unspeakable violations preceded this despicable act and it ended with the desperate man’s suicide. A web of evil, like a viral contagion, had spread from this vile act throughout our community, a dark eldritch leviathan rearing its head. But with Leland’s tragic resolution, it seemed, the fever gripping our town had broken. The leviathan slowly submerged Throughout this ordeal, and its aftermath, I befriended Cooper. We shared many enjoyable discussions — without either of us revealing the covert connections we shared — and found solace in each other’s company. Then, one night soon afterward, most unexpectedly, came a breakthrough at the LPA. A message received loud and clear through the chatter and chuff droning through my instruments. Three words, plain English, in a sea of random signals: Cooper … Cooper … Cooper I traced it to its source, stunned to realize it did not issue from the vastness of space, but from somewhere in the surrounding woods of Ghostwood Forest. I wanted to tell Cooper about this message – a clear violation of my charter, but when I raised the idea with Colonel Milford he wholeheartedly He also told me the LPA would be my responsibility now, alone, until my new control arrived. He’d found one last chance for happiness in this new marriage and he was taking it. He held no illusions this young woman was the great love of his life but knew she was assuredly the last. I sought out Cooper and shared the message with him — dispassionately, curiously, as a man of science — and in that spirit he considered it. As a bond of friendship, I invited him to join me on a camping and fishing trip into the Ghostwood and he accepted. We left that very afternoon. Late that night, during a delightful conversation before the fire, he went to answer a call of nature. Before he returned, the leviathan came for white light issuing from a suggestion of some mass or object above me, a silent dark-robed figure beckoning. Paralyzed with terror, I seemed to move without volition to some other space. Alone but in the presence of some immense, overwhelming force, as if gravity had increased a thousandfold. A flood of words sluiced through my mind, words not my own, nor in any language known to me, a voice metallic, ringing and bitter. This was knowledge, I sensed through my terror, from some unknown order, of a higher vibrational quality beyond my ability to process, uncanny, perhaps electromagnetic in nature and not in the remotest way human. But what was it? What was it trying to show me? Whatever I’d been sent into these woods to find had after all this time found me first, roughing me up like a midnight dockside beatdown. Whatever this presence might be, it possessed nothing benign or benevolent in form or content, only a cold, crushing, calculating pressure. Time itself stood still, as if whatever place they’d brought me stood outside it. Throughout the ordeal I clung to one vague hope: If I survived, did this test hold some promise of revelation? I not only feared for my life; I feared the annihilation of my soul. I saw many things I don’t remember. I heard other voices I can’t recall. All around me colors constantly phased through the spectrum, blue to green, red to violet, black to white. I felt alternately like a ragged empty doll, then nothing but searing pain that rent my flesh with sadistic ease. I saw eyes, watching, felt pressure in my mind, as if thoughts were being forcibly inserted. I’m fairly certain I journeyed back and forth through time, watching it unspool like some immense, omniscient recording. Then I was back in the woods alone. Not far from our campsite, fire cold, deserted. Pale daylight, which my mind, coming back to itself, recognized: morning. That small shard of human experience became my lifeline, and I followed it back to what I used to think of as reality. I rested awhile, listless and spent. Found a stream and drank from it, splashed water on my face, breathed good air again, felt the sun on my face and realized: I’m alive. Somehow I made it down the mountain, which took all day. As night fell I staggered into my home, to my wife and son. So grateful to see their faces, determined to never take them for granted ever again. My wife told me I’d been missing for three days. Cooper had returned to town and initiated a search. They’d begun to fear they’d never find me. I ate, sparingly, then almost at once fell into a deep, dreamless sleep. I slept 16 hours, awoke and found myself back in time again, feeling it infuse its familiar rhythms back into my skin and bones. Ate ravenously, like a starving animal. I felt a dull, throbbing pain on the back of my neck. Betty noticed there were marks, symbols really, carved, burned or branded there. Interlocking triangles. I’d seen these marks before. On the bodies of other “abductees” — the three children who’d been lost in these woods: Margaret Lanterman, Carl Rodd and another boy who’d moved away and since passed on. And Doug Milford. Now whatever force or thing this was had placed its mark on me. Yes, I thought, as resolve flooded back to me, I’d discovered what the colonel had brought me here to find. The source itself had “chosen” me as well. I needed to tell him. Then I learned that Colonel Milford had died at the Great Northern Hotel three nights earlier. When I returned to the LPA later that day, I found an encrypted message waiting on my computer, written and sent on the night I went missing. If I hadn’t so recently experienced my own private nightmare in the woods the colonel’s last words would have made little sense to me. Now they seared my soul. Doug left no instructions in his will about how to dispose of his remains — I think some part of him believed he would live forever. His brother Dwayne suggested cremation and scattering his ashes near the Pearl Lakes, where not so long before we’d put Robert Jacoby to rest. So that’s what we did, a small group of us, “grieving” widow not included. Afterward I repaired to the LPA and set about securing the dossier Doug and I had created. I crafted a custom protective case and prepared a hiding place. I scrutinized Doug’s final words to me; he had been my “control,” and now that he was gone, a new control would appear. An ally who knew the score, but I had no idea who this might be, or from where they might come. I awoke before dawn the next morning with a stark and startling revelation. During the night, my subconscious mind had made a breakthrough, sifting through the jumbled wreckage of numbers and strange language and my lost time in the woods until all the pieces fell together and I felt with swift and utter certainty that I knew how to proceed toward the answers that Doug had been so certain we could never find. The answer, in other words — as best I can describe — had been “downloaded” into my mind during my “abduction,” and left there for me to sort it out. Which against all odds I had done. So I awoke knowing that the identity of my “control,” the person I needed to complete our mission, was right in front of me, in the mysterious message I’d already received: Cooper. Of course. Perfect sense. It must be Cooper. All the stars aligned. Why else would Gordon Cole have sent him here? Maybe Cooper wasn’t yet fully aware of the whys or wherefores himself, but I’d learned by now that “chance” events often prove providential, convincing myself that Special Agent Dale Cooper would be the one with whom I’d carry on this work. I reached out to him that morning. Called his room at the Great Northern. No answer. I tried the sheriff’s station. Lucy informed me that Cooper had gone off with the sheriff the night before on some mission into the woods. Alarmed, I asked her to connect me by radio to them. She did so. Truman wouldn’t reveal the purpose of their trip over the air, but told me that, once they’d arrived, Cooper had disappeared during the night. They had no idea where he’d gone and were still waiting for him. They were at a place not far from where Cooper and I had gone camping called Glastonbury Grove. That news, and a slight tremor in his tone, alarmed me beyond reason. I feverishly set to work at the LPA, preparing I feverishly set to work at the LPA, preparing our elaborate “mayday” protocols. During my work that day I received a call from Truman telling me Cooper had finally returned to the same spot where he’d left them. He didn’t say what happened to him in the interim—I don’t think he knew—but they were taking him back to the Great Northern. Cooper said he needed rest. Greatly relieved, I asked Sheriff Truman to have Agent Cooper contact me at my home. As soon as I could manage, I wanted to share this dossier with him and present a full picture of what I’ve discovered. If he responded as I hoped he would, I’d take him to the LPA and share with him what I’d discovered. Only moments ago, while writing the previous passage, Cooper called, as I had requested. He’s on his way to the house right now—the bell just rang, he’s here. Betty is letting him in… 12:05 PM MARCH 28, 1989 He just left. Something’s wrong. The message holds the answer, just as I thought, but I’ve misinterpreted it. Protocols are in place. I must act quickly. I’m heading I’m heading to the LPA alone. \n",

      "Selftext: I have been rewatching the original series/FWWM lately so that I can get caught up enough to rewatch all of The Return and I have so many conflicting opinions and questions about Leland Palmer's character...\n",
      "\n",
      "As we should all know by now, Leland Palmer raped and murdered his daughter, as well as Theresa Banks, while he was being possessed by the malicious Black Lodge spirit known as Bob. Admittedly, I watched Fire Walk With Me before getting to that big episode in Season 2 where it is finally revealed who Laura's killer is. After seeing the movie, it really seemed to me that although Leland Palmer was possessed, ultimately BOB merely brought to surface the inner demons/desires that Leland always had. He is a highly abusive father, as indicated in the dinner table scene where he is yelling at Laura for having dirt under her fingernails and being unclean, and his wife Sarah is too terrified to meaningfully intervene. Her reluctance to stop him indicated to me a history of this kind of behavior. He is a lawyer that works with seedy businessmen (Benjamin Horne) who is willing to do whatever repugnant behavior necessary to legally protect his client. He cheats on his wife with underage prostitutes. Even as he is about to kill his daughter in the train car, he gets in her face and says \"I thought you always knew it was me...\", almost to express that he thought Laura knew it was him molesting her all of these years, and is surprised that Laura is surprised. It's like the real Leland is raping his daughter with this Bob merely acting like a catalyst, and this would make it reasonable to blame Leland, and not Bob, for the horrible things he has done. It is Leland who has sex with Theresa Banks, but Bob brings out the desire to murder her after she blackmails him when finding out he is the father of her friend/prostitute-colleague Laura (who is only prostituting herself because of her broken spirit caused by the horrid traumas she's experienced as a victim of sexual abuse). \n",
      "\n",
      "But then I get to the big reveal in S2 and it really seems like the show completely gives Leland a free pass to all of the horrible things he has done; he need not bare any of the responsibility. Despite the scene after Leland dies in the jail cell where Cooper, Albert, and Sheriff Truman debate over what exactly BOB is, with the conclusion being that the answer is totally up in the air, I can not get over the fact that BOB possessing Leland his entire life really does conveniently explain ALL of his repugnant behavior and essentially absolves Leland of any responsibility to bear the weight of what he did to his daughter.\n",
      "\n",
      "As he is dying, Leland says: \"Oh my god, Laura. I killed her. Oh my god, I killed my daughter! I didn't know, forgive me! Forgive me! I was just a boy, I saw him in my dreams, he said he wanted to play. He opened me, and I invited him, and he came inside me. When he was inside, I didn't know, and when he was gone, I couldn't remember. He made me do things, terrible things. He said he wanted lives, he wanted others to use like they used me...Oh god, they had me kill that girl Theresa. They made me kill Laura\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This dialogue makes it seem like in Leland's mind, he was fighting as BOB took control of his physical body and was aware of the horrible things he was doing but had no ability to stop them, and then when Bob's possession subsided and Leland regained control, he would not remember what had happened. So then why does Leland suddenly remember everything in this scene? Is it because BOB has now left his body when Leland is delivering this dialogue so he is able to access these memories?  But my bigger point is, this really does explain away all of his behavior. He has been historically abusive towards his daughter (and possibly his wife) for the entirety of her life because he has had an evil spirit controlling his body since he was a young boy. He has sex with young prostitutes and kills them when they get out of control because an evil spirit is controlling his body. He is a seedy lawyer because an evil spirit is controlling his body. It just really seems to dismiss the seriousness of Laura's experiences. Oh, you were completely destroyed by the traumatic abuse you've endured your entire life at the hands of your father? Turns out it's not really his fault, he's being controlled by a supernatural entity and never would have done any of those things otherwise! There just doesn't seem to be enough obfuscation of Leland's motives in the show; he is just helplessly possessed and can do nothing about Bob's actions, and only remembers the things he's done once Bob decides to discard Leland as a vessel (which I also don't get, if Bob was trying to leave Leland and possess another person, why not just do exactly what he does in that jail cell and make the body he's in commit suicide?). But in the movie it seems like Lynch is retconning this idea and chooses to blur the line of who Leland really is and why he did what he did. Despite Lynch's attempts, however, it still feels like I can now watch that entire movie and explain everything away with \"Bob is making him do it\". \n",
      "\n",
      "I want to hear others think about this, and would really love it if maybe people could point to moments in the first 2 seasons where Leland's actions aren't so cleanly explained away as they seem to be in the movie, because it doesn't feel right to me that David Lynch/Robert Frost would minimize the seriousness of Laura's experiences as being those caused by supernatural phenomenon. \n",

      "Title: (Spoilers Extended) Theory: The Dream of Spring, and A Thought of Ending\n",
      "Selftext: This just comes into my mind after thinking more about the themes and structure of the books, and I was thinking to myself, how could I end the story with thematic consistency instead of what is exciting and pleasing to see, and I think this theory could be potentially satisfying within the framework that is laid down by the books.\n",
      "\n",
      "What if the Dream is just another word for hope? That means the heroes, whoever that maybe and still standing, will not be able to stop the Others, because they represent a force of nature, which can't be realistically stopped, and it is part of a natural cycle. The Dream of of Spring could be a short hand for human resilience, how we can maintain hope in face of near extinction, and proceed to pick ourselves up, rebuild and thrive. This parallels with real life research about population bottleneck which suggests that at one point the human population was reduced to ~10k, possibly due to volcanic winter.\n",
      "\n",
      "It fits well with the themes of the books, because they keep reminding us that the characters that we see are not our conventional fantasy heroes who can overcome all the challenges with they determination, wits, and skills. No matter how socio-politically important or how popular this person is, no matter what personal achievements they have acquired, they still cannot fight the universe or larger societal forces at work, that's the point about the Sparrows.\n",
      "\n",
      "A case in point is Quentyn Martell. He is a young prince from Dorne overcoming challenges and ordeals just to reach Mereen to ask for his princess's hand. An ordinary telling of a fantasy story would make him the hero and after taming the dragons, he would fly back with the dragons and his princess and yank of the yoke of the tyrant and eveybody will live happily ever after. But instead, he is roasted alive. Some people say this Quentyn story derails the plot and achieves nothing in terms of story flow. This could be true, but I think it is an important thematic device that is there to remind us not to root for any seemingly \"heores\", because they are only gonna get roasted if they are going up against the force of nature, which is represented by the dragons here, as it has been in real life through out centuries. \n",
      "\n",
      "It is also there to foreshadow thematically that it does not matter who wins the war and takes the throne at the end, the civil wars are human hubris at the highest and most destructive level, and that we are unready to face any force of nature that is beyond our ordinary experience, and once we realize that it will be too late.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, it would not be thematically fitting to have our exiting cast of characters to be *THE* prophetic hero who can against all odds throw the Other back where they come from. The more fitting conclusion is to leave the task to the next generation, as they represent hope, improvement, and fertility: the opposite of Winter.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, while Jon Snow can still be a form of Azhor Ahai, who can defeat the Others in *a* battle, but not winning the war, he still may not necessarily be the Prince Who Was Promised. GRRM has played this trick before about the translation and the twisted nature of prophecies, so we have no reason to take the prophetic words literally.\n",
      "\n",
      "What if Azhor Ahai and the Prince Who Was Promised are father and son/daughter? As a family, they can be mentioned interchangeably, and the child can be their father's best instrument or chief lieutenant, aka Lightbringer. Azhor Ahai's tempering his sword with Nissa Nissa can be interpreted as sex and/or childbirth: the symbolic *sword* thrusts in, bind with her *soul*, her essence, and comes out as a child, a figuratively *sword*, the personification of Lightbringer, and also the Prince Who Was Promised. If Dany is the parallel of Nissa Nissa, then it would mean she would probably die of childbirth. It is this child who will herald the coming of Spring. The dragon has three heads could also be referring to this family.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think the Song of Ice and Fire is his.\n",
      "\n",
      "Edit: please set a 20 year reminder to see if this theory will turn out to be correct.\n",

      "I was nerd-triggered by the Guardian article stating that [\"Game of Thrones has lost its evil streak – and it's a crying shame\"](https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/aug/18/game-of-thrones-has-lost-its-evil-streak-and-its-a-crying-shame). I was going to comment on the original post, but my mini-rant became too long, so I thought I'd make a separate post and get your thoughts.\n",
      "\n",
      "I believe the Guardian misses the point and intention of the series, and I think a lot of us share their view of the series: that Game of Thrones is supposed to be miserable, and tragic, and have no happy endings for no one, which extends into comments like \"Jaime shoulda died at the loot train battle\", \"How tf did he survive?\" \"Jon coming back is so cliche and lame!\" \"How could Ramsay lose to Jon, it's too heroic and good!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So this post attempts to answer two questions:\n",
      "\n",
      "**1. So what's going on with this season? Why is the plot armor so high? Why does everything seem to be so heroic and action-y without any of the major characters dying?**\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. Has the show lost its \"Anyone can die randomly\" mantra? Are D&amp;D ruining GRRM's vision and themes?**\n",
      "\n",
      "I'll try and answer the 2nd one first, which will provide a little more context as to what's up with this season's thick plot armor. \n",
      "\n",
      "##**Has the show lost its \"Anyone can die randomly\" mantra? Are D&amp;D ruining GRRM's vision and themes? I'd argue \"No\".**\n",
      "\n",
      "From the article:\n",
      "\n",
      "&gt;In Game of Thrones, horrible stuff can happen without an underlying reason or logic. \n",
      "\n",
      "&gt;But as the show gallops towards its conclusion, something seems to have changed. Game of Thrones has become risk-averse. Where once no one was safe, now its lead characters are wrapped in cotton wool, or even worse, able to be brought back from the dead like Jon Snow.\n",
      "\n",
      "The whole \"anyone can die randomly\" is a lazy generalization that doesn't look at the narrative logic or tapestry of GRRM's work as a whole. \n",
      "\n",
      "ACTUAL random killings for shock value is something you find on *The Walking Dead*, where the cast is an ever-rotating cast of characters who die every mid-finale and finale, but very rarely  does their death affect the trajectory of the story or characters in any major way: at its core, the story is about humans fighting for survival and shelter from the zombies (not a knock on TWD as I love it, but it's a different beast).\n",
      "\n",
      "In GOT, ONE death sends the whole story reeling in a completely different direction. Ned starts the War of the Five Kings. The Red Wedding propels Arya to Braavos. Joffrey send Tyrion on a downard spiral out of King's Landing and out to Essos. Every death may *seem* shocking and random at first glance, but in hindsight we see how the seeds were planted, and how, through their choices and flaws, their deaths are almost *inevitable*. They all serve extremely important functions in the plot and the story.\n",
      "\n",
      "The article also states:\n",
      "\n",
      "&gt;\"There is no long arc of history bending towards justice.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Which is true. But this isn't history. This is a fantasy **story**. ***A story by its very nature HAS to have an arc, a journey, a point.***\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's do a little deductive logic: if we know that D&amp;D know the ultimate plot points and fates of all these characters, and their fates in the show \"bend\" towards justice or some sort of bittersweet \"happy\" conclusion, then we can reasonably assume that **GRRM's original story also bends towards some form of justice or a happy ending.**\n",
      "\n",
      "This possibility shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone who knows that the final book of the series was originally supposed to be called *A Time for Wolves*, a strong choice of words suggesting justice and triumph for the Starks (inarguably *the* good guys of this story).\n",
      "\n",
      "If everything feels too neat and tidy, it's because it's the final act of the story. If everything starts turning up aces for the good guys, maybe it's because the whole point was that the good guys finally triumph in the face of all their heartbreak and tragedy. If the story loses it's \"evil streak\" its because it's the end of the story, and, if the story truly does have a \"bend towards justice\", then that evil streak eventually has to lose out at some point.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's basic story structure for a \"fantasy\" story, no matter how dark and gory: The main character has a goal, they go through a series of trials and shit that gets worse and worse and worse and worse, but ultimately prevails against all odds.\n",
      "\n",
      "To quote Harvey Dent: **\"The night is darkest just before the dawn.\"** This is a theme that is repeated throughout any fantasy/adventure story that has a hopeful message at the end, no matter how grim. See: *The Dark Knight*, *The Lord of the Rings* with losing Gandalf , *The Matrix* trilogy, *Harry Potter*, *Stranger Things*... all have had \"happy\" endings and all have gotten EXTREMELY dark right up until the end, where the hero ultimately triumphs or achieves their goal, usually as a result of great personal sacrifice.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, in my biased mind, at least, **just because GRRM wants to have a grey, messy, not super clear good-vs-evil tale and subvert all the fantasy tropes, it DOESN'T mean he still doesn't want to tell a story with a \"happy\" ending.** It just means he'll do it in a more realistic way, through bloodshed, tragedy, and chaos. But, sometimes, life can indeed have a happy ending where the good guys win. It's no less realistic than the rest of the time when the bad guys win.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, with the notion that GRRM's endgame might in fact lead to a \"happy ending\" for some of these characters, we can assume that, no, the showrunners are NOT trying to destroy the original fate or message of these characters and this story. \n",
      "\n",
      "##**So what's going on with this season? Why is the plot armor so high? Why does everything seem to be so heroic and action-y without any of the major characters dying? My answer: they're being used for maximum entertainment value!**\n",
      "\n",
      "This seems to stem from the adaptation process. But here's the basis - D&amp;D know the *true* poetic, perfect GRRM-fates for all of these characters:\n",
      "\n",
      "- We all know/hope that Jaime's fate might end up as the Queenslayer, killing another monarch to save the city and redeem his honor.\n",
      "\n",
      "- We all know Tyrion's fate is tied with dragons, somehow, and possibly being a dragonrider\n",
      "\n",
      "- Jon was resurrected to discover his true lineage as the rightful heir to the Iron Throne\n",
      "\n",
      "- Dany may end up as the Mad Queen following in her father's footsteps\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the showrunners have all this information. BUT, so, what are they supposed to do until they reach the endgame?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yesterday's great post about how nothing really changed for the status of the characters is spot-on, and commenter /u/blackbear25 had a great way to describe it: **Season 7 is like a frantic chess exchange with big pieces that doesn't change much, season 3 is like realizing that pawn you lost on turn 4 is costing you dearly.**\n",
      "\n",
      "That's exactly what's happening - the showrunners CAN'T make any major moves with their big players until the rest of the story catches up to the final fates of these characters. So what to do until then?\n",
      "\n",
      "Simple. **The showrunners are sacrificing in-universe reason and logic to make sure these characters have big, fun, meaty scenes and action-packed episodes.** \n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, this does make the quality of the writing suffer, and yes, some of the logic and the entire Wight plan seem waaaaaay too convoluted. But in return, we get awesome stuff like\n",
      "\n",
      "- Jon being a fucking badass at Hardhome and bitch-slapping a White Walker out of existence\n",
      "- Jon being rezzed and kicking Ramsay's ass\n",
      "- Euron wreaking havoc on the seas in a terrifying and awesome naval battle\n",
      "- Arya decimating the Freys and becoming a basic lv. 100 Assassin\n",
      "- Jaime charging through a field of fire and almost taking out Dany\n",
      "- What's sure to be a fucking amazing episode with the Magnificent 7 north of the Wall\n",
      "\n",
      "So, should this stuff not have happened as it did if we follow the rules of logic? Sure. Jon probably shoulda lost the BotB, Euron probably should have been detected much earlier, Jaime shoulda been turned into the Extra Crispy McKingslayer.... but would those episodes have suffered in quality or excitement if they had been removed? Absolutely, I think so. Now that the showrunners are off-book, we're seeing their true strengths: being able to make epic sequences that are exciting to witness and are often hailed as the highlights of the season.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you for reading.\n",

      "\n",
      "**So what's going on with this season? Why is the plot armor so high? Why does everything seem to be so heroic and action-y without any of the major characters dying? - It's because the showrunners know they can't do anything with the major characters since they KNOW their true fates, so they're using them for maximum entertainment value in the meantime.**\n",

      "Selftext: A couple of weeks ago I made this (admittedly rather salty) [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/6jsl66/experiencing_large_influx_of_network_errors_since/) about how it was almost impossible to play the new gym system &amp; raids on my phone (Xperia Z5 compact). The sheer number of replies indicates that I'm not alone here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since making that post, I have done a little research (much of it frustratingly accidental) into when these errors arise. Whilst I'm no expert on phone hardware (etc.), I can say with some certainty that 'network' errors occur when the phone gets hot. It's been pretty well established that 'network error' doesn't have anything to do with the network in this case - that's just the label this error has in game at the moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "There's no perfect solution to this problem - short of buying a new phone, which I'm sure most of us aren't prepared to do to be able to play a game. However, it is still possible to play, and I have had a lot of success in gyms/raids following these steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "* As soon as the game starts lagging, quit immediately. In my experience waiting will only prolong the pain, and make your phone hotter.\n",
      "* Before attempting a raid, turn your phone off for 10-15 minutes until it is cold. This generally equates to seeing the raid on your app, turning off your phone, walking to the raid, and by the time you arrive your phone is cool enough to complete the raid. You might only get one chance to complete the raid (especially if it is warm out), so make the most of it!\n",
      "* Similarly to the second point - choose between walking and gyms/raids. If you want to take a series of gyms, between each gym, shut down the app.\n",
      "* Try and play when it is cool. Obviously this is not possible everywhere, but my phone can run the game for longer in the morning or evening as opposed to midday. Performance on my (waterproof) phone was particularly good in the cold drizzle of yesterday...\n",
      "* Spend as little time as possible in the menus when attempting a raid/gym. If you can easily complete the raid, just use the default lineup. Consider a naming system so that 'mons you want to use will be at the top of the list.\n",
      "* Spend as little time as possible in the lobby (or just in game) before starting a raid. This is obviously only relevant for raids with 2+ people, and can mean you don't get to pick a complete lineup, but that's better than not battling at all!\n",
      "\n",
      "I hope these points are helpful to some of you with this problem - they have certainly helped me! Two weeks ago I failed to complete an Electabuzz raid, trying for the entire hour, but today I solo'd a Machamp first try.\n",

      "Selftext: Hey guys, just wanted to share my experience and learning points with all of you with regards to running a gaming channel. Firstly, just to give some background information, my channel comprises of short-form videos on indie games and I try to stay away from Let's Plays unless I feel like doing something unique with it since my off the cuff commentary is not the best. I try to keep my videos informative with the objective of highlighting great games and great developers.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was more active on this sub a couple of months back but decided to step away to \"do my own thing\" since I wanted to get more experience making videos and recording myself before seeking further feedback or even offering my thoughts since I wanted to have a pool of experiences that I can draw from. Since then, you guys have added some new mods and more community and Newtubers related stuff, though I'm wondering what is happening with the NewTubers channel and podcast. Also happy to see the success of other channels like /u/LilBigGamers!\n",
      "\n",
      "To go into my stats, I have 51,630 views with 71,170 minutes watched for an average watch time of 1:22 which is honestly pretty terrible. 189 subs:51,630 views is also a terrible ratio all thing considered, so I'm looking to get better with those. On to the lessons learnt:\n",
      "\n",
      "1) Consistency IS key but it is not everything\n",
      "So in the 1 year 4 months so far, I have uploaded 291 videos, with an initial schedule of 3 times per week which had to be reduced to 2 per week more recently due to work. I did miss a 2 videos because I fell ill and took a week off while I was on holiday but I always held the belief that \"If you build it they will come\", but that may not be the only thing. However, do keep in mind that thought this sub and other avenues, I have come across many, many small channels that have come and gone. Perhaps it is a lack of motivation or figuring out that Youtube is not for them, but from these interactions, I have easily come across 20+ channels that are no longer active, despite some of them getting good momentum into the hundreds and 1K+ subscribers. My tip on this is to bank videos if you can just in case for some reason you are not able to put out a video on time.\n",
      "\n",
      "2) Type of content\n",
      "Weirdly enough, while I do stay away from lets plays, my highly views videos both in terms of number of views and watch time are precisely that. Perhaps it is the whole playlist format that allows people to easily watch episodes or simply the niche-ness of the titles chosen. However, I myself wasnt too happy with those videos and the commentary so perhaps its better that I choose not to do these.\n",
      "\n",
      "3) Self Promotion\n",
      "Being a gaming channel, I have found the most success on Twitter since most indie game developers would have a Twitter account. Its not so much a medium to spam links to your channel but to check out what others in the industry are up to. Reddit promotion has been hit and miss. I have seen little to no results from using those \"spammy self promotion\" subs so I'd advise against that. Some good success here and there on Reddit but people generally hate links to YouTube videos so there's that.\n",
      "\n",
      "4) Production\n",
      "I script my videos so these do take a while to produce, but generally I have managed to shorten the overall process which does definitely come with practice. Taking some time to learn shortcuts and what your video editing program is capable of is also highly recommended! An Audio editing program like Audacity is also recommended to clean up your audio.\n",
      "\n",
      "5) Tags and SEO\n",
      "Again, this takes some time to learn and t find what works for you. While extensions like vidIQ and Tubebuddy do help, I generally find that their single word tags are not all that helpful. Do remember to include your channel name as a tag to link your videos together!\n",
      "\n",
      "6) Presentation\n",
      "As a creator I believe in presenting yourself well to you audience and any potential viewers. The most simple step is to double check out spelling a grammar when you type anything anywhere. Read through your posts quickly before publishing anything, including your video titles, descriptions and About Page (tough of course, mistakes can be made). On the channel layout, browse your favorite channels to get an idea of how to organize your own channel page. Of course, this does not really apply if you have 20 or less videos so do keep making those as well!\n",
      "\n",
      "7) On Motivation\n",
      "I think that everyone at some point in time does get demotivated and uninspired, whether it be from looking at your abysmal analytics or feeling as if you are not getting the engagement that you feel like you deserve. My advice is to keep on keeping on. I have had ups and downs in views and subscribers and all of that. However, what keeps me going is my original intent for the channel which is, as mentioned, to highlight great games and developers to anyone who would listen. \n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway, hope these thoughts and lessons will help you guys. For discussion, share something abut your journey thus far on Youtube and any lessons that you think may help others as well. Thanks for your time!\n",

      "\n",

      "\"I think raising children without faith will present unique challenges but also great benefits. For example, religion provides a very simple reason to do and not to do things: god said so and if you listen to god you'll be happy and/or blessed. That format is easy to follow and teach.  For me that is too slippery of a slope. God only speaks through men and feelings. However, the men and feelings he relies on have made significant and harmful mistakes over the years.  (Examples: blacks and the priesthood, condoning slavery, mass killings, polygamy and polyandry, being against women's rights, etc)\n",

      "A more reliable model for our morality is to take a humanist approach of doing good to others. This is based on the fact that we are social creatures who are engineered this way. We derive fulfillment and satisfaction from positive contribution.  These facts are verifiable and evidence based. They can be discovered through research and study. The great benefit of teaching research and study is that it prepares children for their adult lives.  Children who learn that unbiased research is how we learn truth will be self sufficient in all areas of their lives. \n",
      "\n",
      "The difficulty in raising children in the way of faith is that research is restricted to sources that support predetermined conclusions. We are told to start with a conclusion and find data that supports it, not the other way around.  Rather than expanding our worldview, this limits it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although churches profess to encourage research, it is interesting to see how the facts have changed over time. What we were told is anti-Mormon 10 years ago is now proven true on the official church website in the church essays.  The age of the internet is forcing the hand of the church to acknowledge the whole history.  I'm hopeful the church encourages its members to see the entire history and to make conclusions themselves.  \n",

The issue is same as in [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/comments/61o8fv/bijin_wives_muiri_hair_bug_sse/).

      "Selftext: Sure, there are lots of articles that tell you how to play certain decks, but how about the inverse?  Where are the guides telling you how to BEAT popular decks?  I just wrote this one for Burn Mage that got published at Hearthstone Top Decks.  \n",
      "\n",
      "http://www.hearthstonetopdecks.com/anti-deck-guide-beat-burn-mage/\n",
      "\n",
      "Excerpt: \n",
      "\n",
      "**Their Game Plan:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Burn Mage is flexible and can play two primary types of games well, including the ability to switch between these plans during the game depending on board state, clock, and Hero Health: \n",
      "\n",
      "* The Burn Plan: Burn us down, using some combination of early minion chip damage, snowballing Mana Wyrms, burn spells to face, Alex, and Ice Block delays.  In this plan, they just kill us, typically this goes into effect when they can count up enough damage over 1-3 turns while being confident you can’t kill them first.\n",
      "\n",
      "* The Control Plan: Control the board and outvalue us, using some combination of AOE and burn to keep our board clear while accruing bigger threats through Firelands Portals, Atiesh summons, and deploying their own Big Threats.\n",
      "\n",
      "Against control they want to apply early pressure with Mana Wyrms and their high health two drops, hoping to chip in damage and make us react to their board while drawing cards through the midgame hoping to accrue their high-power late game to combo and/or burn us down.\n",
      "\n",
      "Against aggro they want to keep the board clear utilizing their early minions, Volcanic Potion, Frostbolt, and Hero Power– preserving as much of their life total as possible so that when the game moves mid to late they can control the board with burn and large AOE while they finally build a board with late game cards and overwhelm us.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Our Game Plan:**\n",
      "\n",
      "In general, the best way to beat a Burn Mage is *board presence and pressure*.  If we can consistently apply pressure to the Mage, they will be forced to expend their mana on removal, and their burn on minions—thereby protecting our hero’s health.  If we have the board, they will be unable to push damage, and if they are forced to spend their burn on minions to preserve their own health total, they will ultimately have no way to kill us.  If we can keep the board after Turn 7, and hopefully have their health in jeopardy, they will not have time to work towards their power cards or go on a multiple turn Burn Plan, because they will just die.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, this can be more difficult than it sounds due to their powerful removal tools, both AOE and Burn.  We must walk this tightrope carefully, applying just the right amount of pressure to beat them.  We need to be careful to play around everything we can, not overextending into AOE, or laying out juicy single targets for removal and possible tempo swings.\n",
      "\n",
      "An alternative game plan for very Controlling decks, especially those with significant heal, is to go almost completely reactive and simply *prevent them from being able to kill you*.  For example, holding weapon removal for Medivh, saving cards like Priest of the Feast or Armorsmith until after Alexstrasza, removing their board and healing back up out of burn range.  Burn Mages can be exhausted by defensive decks and simply run out of steam.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Summary**\n",
      "\n",
      "If we’re the aggressive deck, we’re looking to maximize pressure while minimizing the effectiveness of their removal.  It is a game of efficiency and making them uncomfortable and reactive.\n",
      "\n",
      "If we’re the control, we’re looking to load up and prepare to respond to their power turns, we watch their game plan and efficiently rebuff their threats, keep or heal ourselves out of burn range and exhaust them.\n",
      "\n",
      "When possible, maintain board presence and pressure…  The more we can control the board, the more likely it is that we will either kill them with offense, or exhaust their resources, making it impossible for them to kill us.  When the Mage is on their back foot—expending their mana and burn on our board rather than our face—they can neither develop to push damage across the board or accrue enough burn damage to scorch our face.\n",
      "\n",
      "… but do not overextend.  Burn Mage relies heavily on their powerful AOE.  Each time you are entering an AOE turn, and debate playing a minion into a board you already control, take a moment to consider if you need it.  Is this board already something they want to Volcanic Potion or Flamestrike?  If so, playing out another 1/2 or 3/4, respectively, is simply giving them a better AOE and wasting a card.  Do we really want to play a 4/5 into an empty board when a Mage is going into 7 mana?  We might just be handing them a juicy Firelands Portal target.  Remember, their spells are highly interactive.  Let’s do our best to force them to interact inefficiently.\n",

      "Selftext: So recently, I've become very interested in Argonians. I had generally accepted the ambiguous answer from ESO development that beast races had the same life spans of men but then I stumbled across some articles and videos about how long reptiles can live. So I did some more research.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now as we know, the Argonians are a species of amphibious reptilian people. A general rule about reptiles, the bigger they are, the longer they'll live. The Komodo Dragon, the largest lizard in the world, can live up to 30 years. Not a long time by our standards. But the Argonians are necessarily 'lizards'. For example, the crocodile. Not a lizard, but instead a member of the group Archosauria. Crocodiles can live up to 100 years old, like humans. Another example of long life in reptiles is of course, the tortoise.\n",
      "\n",
      "Confirmed reports of 150 years old and suspected reports of 200 years, the tortoise is one of the longest lived animals on the planet. But they only live so long because of their slow metabolism, much slower than that of a human's. And that slow metabolism is slowly killing their species. So taking purely natural effects into play, it is very plausible that an Argonian lives the same amount of time as a human. But the kicker is The Hist.\n",
      "\n",
      "The mysterious race of sentient trees that the Argonians have an intimate connection with, so intimate that Argonians often lick its sap before mating during other occasions. They are rumored to even move. Everything about these trees scream magic and we all know some of the benefits of magic in Tamriel.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think, if an Argonian has a strong spiritual and physical connection with The Hist, they could  live to 150 years old even without magical talent. Of course, they are some who say that Argonian's lose their connection with The Hist the longer they are away from Black Marsh. Which could shorten their lifespan. But even without the Hist, I would find it believable that Argonian's could live up to 120 years old and that is all natural. No magic, little contact with The Hist.\n",
      "\n",
      "But take a talented Argonian Magic User with a strong connection to The Hist and a healthy lifestyle. I think it would be very likely that they could live to be around 400-450 years old. Maybe even 500. Of course that would be ancient by then but I believe it is possible. But consider the magical effect on elves. The developers of ESO said Elves not using magic could live to 300 and we have on record of legendary level elves living to 4000 years old. Taking into consideration the magical nature of The Hist and Argonians themselves, a 500 year old Argonian Wizard is very plausible.\n",

      "Selftext: So I have this neighbor who has a bunch of bamboo on his property. About a week ago, one of the plants started hanging into the middle of the road like [this.](http://imgur.com/a/L2qLz) It is perfectly at windshield height and goes halfway into our small, residential road; it essentially creates a one lane situation. Everyone drives slowly (&lt;25 mph) on this road as it's small and there is no reason to go faster than that. I live at the dead end of this road and have to go by the bamboo plant every time I leave/return to my house.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's my problem: I have to get to work so early in the morning that it is pitch black out when I'm leave my house. There are no functioning street lights I forget that the bamboo is there and don't notice it until it's too late to safely move out of the way. Every morning I hit it with my windshield and it scares the daylights out of me. One of my town's senior police officers (I don't know his actual title) lives on my road and is fully aware of the hazard, yet nothing has happened so I don't think he's said anything to anyone. A few days ago, I called my town's non-emergency police number and they told me they would look into the matter. They're very busy and in the mean time, my parents (who I live with) said they could \"deal with it\" themselves. I really think this is a bad idea because if something bad happens to the rest of the bamboo plant, my parents are liable for the damages. On top of that, it's just not nice. This neighbor is super sketchy, so I'm not going to knock on his door and be like \"Can you trim your plant please?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "My plan for now is to just keep hitting the cursed thing with my car every morning until it dies, mostly because I keep forgetting it's there. I'm not sure if this makes me liable for damages to the plant, though. Additionally, if my car were to get damaged by the bamboo plant, would my neighbor be liable for the damages to my car?\n",

      "Selftext: hey everyone, you may already know this but I just ran into an issue with chopping wood on the Z-lev above my fort. I didnt realize but apparently chopping trees down can leave holes in the ground, if you have dug out the square under it then creatures can fall/jump down and gain access to your fort without having to go through the gates. The best solution is to make sure your fort is at least 2 levels below where you are harvesting wood but if you already have an established fort and want to harvest wood from directly above it, you are still able to but I would recommend building a floor over the holes that are left to keep baddies out. You can tell if the tree left a hole by inspecting the chop site and checking for ground or open space.\n",

They don't play C9 or IMT again unless they meet in playoffs. They play CLG once in the #scripted last game of the Summer Split. However, they will meet rising P1 for the first time in two series over the next 4 weeks.\n",

Bottom lane also proves to be exciting as it pits the most dominant laning ADC Doublelift versus the most dominant teamfighting ADC Arrow. \n",
      "* **Fans Should Root For**: TSM to either win it all for the glory or, if TSM can't pull out 1st place, for TSM to place higher than C9 at playoffs. Doing so would insure that they get to attend Worlds on points alone. Something interesting to note: if TSM doesn't make it to Summers finals and C9 does, fans should cheer for a C9 win since C9 taking first would autoqualify them for Worlds and mean that TSM's 90 points could secure them a Worlds spot. Otherwise, TSM would have to play the gauntlet.\n",

They do play 1 series each versus 2nd place IMT and newly strong P1, but they also don't face TSM or CLG at all unless they meet in playoffs. The rest of their 6 series are against teams in the bottom 6. \n",
      "* **Road to Worlds**: C9 is also one of the few teams with all three routes open to them. They can either qualify through winning summer, points, or the gauntlet. \n",
      "* **New 2nd Half Opponent: NV**: The current inconsistencies in C9 could be toppled by the strength of Lira's early game. It's up to Spring 2017 Rookie of the Split Contractz to prevent this from happening and get C9 to the stage of the game where their superior macro will be no match for NV's shaky ability to close games.\n",
      "* **Fans Should Root For**: C9 to win it all or for TSM to take first place in playoffs. A first place win by TSM will mean that C9 should qualify on points barring any major catastrophe since the other top two teams CLG and IMT have only 10 and 0 points respectively going into playoffs. \n",
      "* **Possible Roadblock**: If either TSM or C9 does not win 1st, C9 will have to place higher than TSM to skip the gauntlet. However, if C9 does end up in the gauntlet, their points should be high enough to give them good seeding and an easier run.\n",

Their tiny amount of points from Spring makes them an unlikely points qualifier. Strangely, I am pretty sure the bloodiest team in the LCS is perfectly fine with their odds. \n",
      "* **New 2nd Half Opponent: DIG**: DIG's current downward trend versus CLG's continued improvement should make these two series easy work for CLG. However, CLG's Freudian death wish to fall to teams they should easily beat made me hesitant to even put that in writing.\n",
      "* **Fans Should Root For**: CLG as the Summer 2017 Champions. Otherwise, a small chance exists for CLG to qualify on points if TSM wins Summer and C9 tilts so hard off the face of the earth they don't make playoffs at all.

      "* Steepest upward trend of any team in the LCS. This team went 0-6 in the first 3 weeks of Summer and 3-1 in weeks 4 and 5 after addition of Mike \"Memed to Death\" Yeung. They also got a much needed confidence boost at Rift Rivals. \n",
      "* P1's schedule is a 50/50 split. They play 4 series versus top teams TSM, CLG, and C9 and 4 series versus bottom 6 teams DIG, TL, FLY, and FOX. \n",
      "* **Road to Worlds**: Looking at P1's ability to qualify for Worlds is why this post exists. There are so many variables and complications. The craziness stems from the fact that they have 50 championship points while being the 8th place team. P1 can definitely still make it to playoffs based on their current trajectory and schedule. If they make playoffs, they could qualify for Worlds by coming in 1st place or by points if C9 places lower than them and TSM takes 1st. They could also qualify for Worlds through the gauntlet. Moreover, they can qualify for the gauntlet based on just their 50 championship points from Spring as long as they don't come in 9th or 10th because many of the teams in the top 6 have such a tiny number of points.\n",
      "* **New 2nd Half Opponent: TSM**: I discussed this matchup more in the TSM section of the list. Suffice to say the hype is real for their first series as we get to see the Rift Rivals finals that NA deserved.\n",
      "* **Fans Should Root For**:[The Phoenix to continue to rise](http://cdn.esportsmatrix.com/content/images/uploaded/News%20Images/NEWNEW/ezgif-2438886812.gif), Mike Yeung to stay good, and C9 to tilt off the face of the Earth.\n",
      "* **Possible Roadblock**: If TSM wins 1st and C9 qualifies through points (or vice versa), P1's only chance will be the gauntlet where they will most likely have to fight through teams like IMT and CLG in the process. \n",

      "&amp;nbsp;\n",
      "##**5. IMT**\n",
      "I debated putting IMT in the 4th place spot instead of P1 but one factor made me hesitance: their total lack of points from Spring.\n",

      "* Strongest early split performance but might be slowing down as evidenced by getting 0-2'd in week 5.\n",

      "* **Road to Worlds**: Based on their total lack of championship points from Spring, IMT is very unlikely to qualify based on points barring catastrophe from multiple teams. Looks like IMT will either have to take 1st or play through the gauntlet. \n",

Or Bjergsen, Jensen, Dardoch, and Mike Yeung getting [Nancy Kerrigan'd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Kerrigan#January_1994_attack) so they have a snowball's chance in hell of qualifying based on points. Otherwise, IMT will have to qualify through the gauntlet though a strong showing in playoff's would improve their seeding. \n",
      "* **Possible Roadblock**: Their nonexistent championship points from Spring not only means it will be almost impossible for them to qualify for Worlds on points - it also means that they are unlikely to get preferential gauntlet seeding unless they place 2nd or 3rd in playoffs.\n",

However, if C9 finishes in 4th and TSM wins, Flyquest can qualify for worlds on points if they place higher than P1. Even still, their likeliest route to World lies through the gauntlet which FLY's jungler Moon said should be no problem since they've got Hai.\n",
      "* **New 2nd Half Opponent: TL**: Flyquest enthusiasts should probably thank their lucky stars that their team is facing the 10th place team twice in their last 8 series. Still, TL has looked incrementally better and Flyquest could easily drop a series to TL if they make one of their famous 50/50 Baron calls. \n",
      "* **Fans Should Root For**: There's not doubt that Flyquest has been slumping but they always seem to pull off an upset when you least expect it. (See: knocking CLG out of Spring 2017 playoffs. It still hurts)\n",
      "* **Possible Roadblock**: The top teams living up to their hype. Flyquest seems unlikely to make it to Worlds if the top 4 maintain their form - especially when they always seem to be one bad shotcall or Wildturtle flash away from total disaster. \n",

      "* NV came out strong at the beginning of the split, but they seem to have mellowed in recent weeks going 2-2 in their last 4 series.\n",
      "* Like Flyquest, NV's schedule is definitely skewed to the harder side. They face C9 twice and play single series versus TSM, IMT, and CLG. Only 3 of their last 8 series are versus bottom 6 teams FOX, TL, and FLY. \n",
      "* **Road to Worlds**: With 0 championship points, NV's path to Worlds more than likely involves either a 1st place finish or the gauntlet. \n",
      "* **New 2nd Half Opponent: C9**: The fact that NV has not yet faced one of the top 4 teams and has to play them twice before playoffs does not bode well for their Worlds chances. However, recent shaky play my C9 could mean that NV surprises and takes one or both series. \n",
      "* **Fans Should Root For**: 1st place or at the very least a good showing at playoffs to improve their gauntlet seeding.\n",
      "* **Possible Roadblock**: NV needs to learn to close games more efficiently and take advantage of the leads gifted to the team by star jungler Lira or their shot at getting through playoffs and/or the gauntlet looks tenuous at best. \n",
      "\n",
      "&amp;nbsp;\n",
      "##**8. DIG**\n",

      "* DIG started the split looking like a top team but have slumped hard in recent weeks going 0-4 during weeks 4 and 5. \n",
      "* Dignitas easily has the 2nd hardest schedule going into the last half of the split. They play 6 series versus strong teams CLG, TSM, IMT, P1, and C9 with only 2 series against weak teams like TL and FOX.\n",
      "* **Road to Worlds**: With 10 championship points, DIG's path to Worlds more than likely involves either a 1st place finish or the gauntlet. Considering their recent slump, they are going to have to exceed expectations to qualify through either of those routes.\n",
      "* **New 2nd Half Opponent: CLG**: Unfortunately for DIG, they have never faced 1st place team CLG and have to face them twice over the next 4 weeks. Considering CLG's recent focus on winning the top side of the map with their Darduo, will Ssumday be able to get rolling during lane phase so he can carry his team to a win?\n",
      "* **Fans Should Root For**: The team to regain their footing. With the difficulty of their schedule and their recent slump, DIG really needs to rally if they don't want to get knocked out of playoffs and lose their spot to teams like FLY and P1. Without a playoffs spot, DIG lose their chance to qualify for the gauntlet and find their Worlds dream ended.\n",
      "* **Possible Roadblock**: Tilt. The combination of their recent downward trajectory and the anticipation of playing through their tough schedule could tilt the best teams much less one that only recently seemed to gain confidence. \n",

      "* Currently sitting at 4-6 FOX has looked unconvincing all split. In weeks 4 and 5, they only won a single series going 1-3. \n",
      "* FOX's schedule for the last half of the split is the hardest of any team's. They play IMT twice and have 1 series each against TSM, CLG, and C9. They have virtually no series versus weak opponents to balance this out as their \"easier\" matches include series versus P1 and middle of the pack teams NV and DIG. \n",
      "* **Road to Worlds**: With 0 championship points, FOX's path to Worlds more than likely involves either a 1st place finish or the gauntlet. However, their first step would be making playoffs. Without playoffs, FOX will have no chance at 1st or the gauntlet as they currently have no championship points.\n",
      "* **New 2nd Half Opponent: IMT**: IMT definitely has the advantage in this matchup since they cleanly finish games while FOX struggles to close even when they have a lead. \n",
      "* **Fans Should Root For**: Major wins for FOX and losses from the likes of C9, DIG, NV, and P1. Those teams will need to put up some losses while FOX rallies for them to have a shot at playoffs. \n",

      "* TL's schedule is not too challenging. They face bottom 6 teams DIG, P1, FLY, and NV in 5 series and top 4 teams IMT, C9, and TSM in 3 series. They also do not have to play current #1 team CLG for the rest of the split. \n",
      "* **Road to Worlds**: With 0 championship points, TL would have to qualify for Worlds via playoffs or the gauntlet. They also have no chance of going to the gauntlet if they do not make playoffs at all. Given their current 2-8 record, qualifying for a Worlds spot would be nothing short of miraculous since there are only 4 weeks left. Multiple teams would have to tank and TL would have to win 65% or more of their remaining games to qualify. \n",
      "* **New 2nd Half Opponent: FLY**: While Flyquest would appear to have the advantage, anything can happen when these two inconsistent teams meet on the Rift. Expect a NA clown fiesta of epic proportions.\n",
      "* **Fans Should Root For**: Other teams tilting off the face of the earth for the rest of the split, TL finally managing to gel, and possibly a few teams getting disqualified for insider trading.\n",

      "\n",
      "**Q: Before the match, have you thought you'd 4-0 Romania?**\n",
      "\n",
      "UD: Yes. We are competing at home. We should bring out our best performance without holding back. \n",
      "\n",
      "**Q: During the match, the casters mentioned that your team was expecting the opponent to choose Horizon: The Lunar Colony, so you prepared for that map?**\n",
      "\n",
      "UD: We are glad that Horizon is a new map. We guessed the opponent would choose it, so we studied the map for 2 days. Then we wouldn't be afraid of it. \n",
      "\n",
      "**Q: Which Romanian player put the most pressure on you during the last match?**\n",
      "\n",
      "UD: Probably the opponent Genji (RANKNoMoJa). I think he is the initiator of their team fight, so if we counter him well we'll be good. \n",
      "\n",
      "**Q: This was your team's first formal match. Compared to past scrims, do you think your team performed as well as they should have?**\n",
      "\n",
      "UD: During scrims, my teammates might get relatively sloppy sometimes, but on stage everyone was very focused and very eager to win. Our strategies were executed somewhere around 200% better. \n",
      "\n",
      "**Q: Who in your team had the best performance today?**\n",
      "\n",
      "UD: It's hard to say who was the best. Everyone performed well. In terms of highlight performance, I think it would be Shy sleepdarted the nanoblade Genji and Eileen's dragonblades.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Q: As a member of Team China, did you feel anything differently (compared to competing as a member of LGD)?**\n",
      "\n",
      "UD: The first difference is that I get to compete with foreign teams. The second is the sense of honor I feel to represent China. I wanted to win even worse, and I wanted to show to the world that we are not weak. (Note: On the Chinese internet, people joke a lot on Chinese teams, since many believe that they are no rival to western and Korean teams.)\n",
      "\n",
      "**Q: Romania played quad tanks on one of the maps in Nepal. How did you react to that?**\n",
      "\n",
      "UD: Our coach team put a lot of faith in me. We have discussed our strats and counter-strats to the opponent's comps. Every match I adjusted our strategy to react to the opponents's comp. If they play quad tanks, we prioritize on their supports. (My teammates) executed it very well. I am very pleased. \n",

      "**Q: What are thoughts on tomorrow's (July 7) match?**\n",

      "\n",
      "aKm: Indeed, we are competing as an entire club. This made it hard for us to compete against unknown teams, because they know everything about us. \n",

      "**Q: Did you learn anything about the Chinese players? Who do you think is the most threatening among them? What is your objective this time?**\n",
      "\n",
      "aKm: Because of time restrictions, we have not learned anything in detail about Team China or other teams. Since it's a competition, of course we want to win. Our objective is to make it to the top. \n",

      "**Q: Have you scrimed against other teams after arriving in Shanghai? How did the scrims go?**\n",

      "\n",
      "aKm: We sure hope for the best. We didn't stomped our way to the championship last year. Rather, we learned our opponents as the matches went, and we improved our situation. We hope the same for this year. We'll pull out our best performance. \n",
      "\n",
      "**Q: You were known for your triple DPS comp, but now you rarely use it. What makes you abandon that comp? Did you choose triple DPS because of your team talents or because it was the best comp?**\n",
      "\n",
      "aKm: When we played triple DPS, there weren't many D.Vas. As D.Va became prevalent, we had to use her as well. We are adjusting our strategy to the current meta. \n",
      "\n",
      "**Q: Which team will be the greatest threat in your group? Which player impressed you the most?**\n",
      "\n",
      "aKm: Denmark will be our greatest threat, because they are composed of pro players, and they have great team synergy. ONIGOD from Norway impressed me. \n",

      "**Q: Did you take tours in Shanghai this time? What do you think of Shanghai?**\n",
      "\n",
      "aKm: I have been to Shanghai before, so I know it to some degree. Because of time restrictions we haven't take any tours. Our hotel this time is located along the Bund. It is a great location for sightseeing, but again, because of time restrictions, we were busy with the press and preparing for the matches. \n",

If you have ever played Earthbound you will know how the gauges roll, but you are never sure of your final HP before you reach there. So I tried solving the problem by making the target value appear above when the value is changing. However I am a bit concerned about the colors I chose. I used Green to signify HP up and Red to signify HP down. Do you think a colorblind person would have trouble with these? What can I do that elegantly solves the problem for them?\n",

      "Selftext: **TL;DR-** UtiliTwitch is a free chrome app that adds more sorting options to game directories e.g. sort from Low-High viewers instead of the default high to low. It's still pretty rough and there are definitely bugs, but I wanted to gauge how much interest there was before putting too much more time into it. \n",

      "\n",
      "On this sub there are frequent questions along the lines of \"how do smaller streamers increase visibility\" or \"how do you discover smaller streamers\" etc, and someone will almost always comment that Twitch should implement an option to randomise the order in which streams are displayed, or give the option to sort them in reverse. I cobbled together a free chrome extension that adds both of these and more into the site.\n",
      "\n",
      "Currently the options for sorting are: by viewers, uptime, account age, alphabetical(by stream title), and random. These could easily be changed to any other stat given by the Twitch API. \n",
      "\n",
      "Speaking of which, UtiliTwitch also has the unintended ability to update the streams shown in a game directory without having to refresh the entire page.\n",
      "\n",
      "The extension is in very rough beta. It works (mostly) but it has bugs. It doesn't currently work properly in directories that Twitch has customised eg cs:go, and it works but displays badly or has other bugs in Overwatch and Creative. These seem fixable. It also doesn't work in conjunction with other sort options like language or those in LoL or Hearthstone. \n",
      "\n",
      "Why release it if it doesn't work 100%? a) It's free. If people absolutely hate it, they can just uninstall and they haven't lost anything bar a few minutes, but more so, b) working around the Twitch site is a PITA. I'd like to gauge how much interest there is rather than keep sinking time into something that nobody may end up using.\n",

      "  \n",
      "* Germantown Pub: This one was described as a 'breakfast burger' and lives up to that label. The bacon jam was rather sweet, plus the fried egg that gets everything all gooey. This is also a 5oz burger week size patty, so not the full experience.   \n",
      "* Jack Brown's: An alright burger. The cream cheese and pepper jelly compliment each other nicely and the burger really isn't spicy like some would think. I feel like the peak Jack Brown's experience was year 1 with the Elvis/Greg Brady.  \n",
      "* The Pharmacy: Definite leader of the pack for \"fancy burgers\" this year. The bun is essentially garlic bread, with some pesto tasting sauce, plus all the grease. This made for the happiest of afternoon food-comas in the office.   \n",
      "* Tower Deli: Quintessential 'All American' burger and it was a good portion. It came without cheese, but it really didn't need it. I would definitely order this one again and again and again. It would have been great with a beer, alas not while on the clock.   \n",
      "* Hermitage Hotel: The meat tasted good on this one. Definitely a no-frills burger, not much else to say.   \n",
      "* Cafe Indigo: I think both of their burger week submissions (year 1 and 3) have been well above average. The bun was toasted/buttered which added to the enjoyment factor. I'm not a huge avocado fan but it worked well on this one.   \n",
      "* Decker &amp; Dyer: Lots of flavors going on here. I think the jalapeno overpowered the rest of the burger so it was a little less tasty than the others I sampled.   \n",
      "  \n",
      "As I've tasted so far, my field stands as such:  \n",

The closest the flashbacks get to character development is the scene where Kara and John make humorous comments about rations, and the scene where John spares Kara, but she doesn't spare him. When talking about the flashbacks being a part of the episode itself: there is a definite connection, as similar to the end of the number plot this week, the end of these flashbacks ends with effectively nothing being done except for a bunch of bad guys killing each other.\n",

It very much surprised the businesswoman in her late thirties, given that the last thing she remembered was the rapidly advancing concrete pavement after she had thrown herself off the twelfth-story balcony of her apartment. Realistically speaking, she should no longer be able to feel pain – or anything at all, for that matter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet here she was. Whatever ''here'' was. From what little she could gather, she was lying on some kind of table within a large room – a kitchen, judging by the presence of multiple stoves, cabinets, and rows upon rows of shelves overflowing with canned spices, bottling jars, and an enormous arsenal of cooking utensils; including dozens of different knives neatly sorted by size and function.\n",
      "\n",
      "She tried to get up and immediately postponed that plan after her back non-vocally threatened to snap in half. Had she survived the fall, even with most of her bones broken? The sharp pain that still pulsed through her body whenever she attempted to move spoke for it, yet she thought it unlikely than anyone would have survived a fall from such heights, and eve if she did, why was she in a place like this, rather than in an ambulance or a hospital?\n",
      "\n",
      "A door somewhere towards Seiko's left opened, and she could hear the distinct clicking noise of pumps on a tiled floor. Before she could work up the effort to turn her head, the face of a young woman hovered over hers. She was a decidedly odd sight; wearing what appeared to be a French maid costume and with hair that already had turned (or had been colored?) gray despite of the fact that she could not be much older than twenty. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Where am I?”, the older of the two females inquired.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Gensokyo. The Scarlet Devil Mansion, to be more precise.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Scarlet Devil Mansion? Seiko had never heard of any such place. Taking all of her power, she once again scanned the room for any type of clues. It slowly dawned on her that not only the clothing of the mysterious stranger looked oddly antiquated and out of place, but the entire area seemed as if taken from some Western historical drama; something out of the Victorian era. Could this mean...\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is...is this one of those cosplay cafes?”\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "*So it was a cosplay cafe!*\n",
      "\n",
      "“Listen, miss”, Seiko hastily began. “I don't even know how I ended up here, but I think I'm hurt pretty badly. I would very much appreciate it if you could call for an ambulance to pick me up and drive to the nearest hospital. I may be in serious need of medical attention.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The maid did nothing of that sort. Instead, she calmly turned her back to the new arrival, trudged towards a nearby kitchen counter, and began cutting tomatoes into thin slices with a blade that appeared oddly large for this particular function. She seemed to be well-experienced in this; the knife in her hand transforming into a blur as it ended the physical integrity of the vegetable in record speed.\n",

      "Truthfully, Seiko had little very desire to explain that her jump from the twelfth story of an apartment block had been very much intentional and stemmed from her earnest desire to die (or rather, the lacking desire to continue living) after she had been fired from her job. Which in turn stemmed from her having grown just a bit too fond of the bottle, which in turn stemmed from the breakup with her husband of six years after she had found him in the bed with another woman whom she had considered her best friend since her highschool days. \n",
      "\n",
      "She did it anyway, occasionally fighting back the tears of a woman who had grown to hate herself almost as much if not more than the man who betrayed her and set all these events into motion. The enigmatic maid did not comment on any of this, calmly continuing to chop up vegetables, stir pots, and wash dishes.\n",
      "\n",
      "“So”, she finally said after the Seiko had finished her story. “You're a suicide victim, then? We've been getting lots of those recently. Most of the people who wind up here are ones, actually. I suppose it's the most convenient way for the gap witch – if people think you would be willing to kill yourself, your sudden disappearance from the outside world won't be seen as much of a mystery. And given that you want to die anyway, bringing you to the mansion does not produce much of a moral issue, either. Everybody wins.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The hairs on Seiko's neck rapidly began rising up. “Gap witch? Moral issue?”, she nervously stammered. “What...what kind of place is this anyway?! How did I get here? And what are you planning to *do* with me?!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“As I already told you, this is the Scarlet Devil Mansion. You were brought here through something akin to a portal leading from one world to another – one that the gap witch presumably opened underneath you mere moments after you closed your eyes in anticipation of the crash.”\n",

It's primary agent actually is meant to put its target into a state of deep slumber, but every so often, it instead causes highly unpleasant muscle cramps and the food wakes up before I can prepare it properly.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Food?! Which food?”\n",
      "\n",
      "The maid did not respond, but gave an answer by drawing forth a large cleaver and began to make her way to the table with the now wildly struggling outsider on it. Her facial expression betrayed neither sadistic joy nor bitter pity. It was just another household task to her, no better or worse than cleaning bookshelves or making the laundry.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No! Please!” The tears of Seiko, barely suppressed when she had narrated her downfall, were now flowing freely. “You can't just kill me!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why not?”, the younger woman said. “You yourself said you wanted to die. And rather than ending up as a broken, limb body on some dirty street, your death will actually have a purpose – your body will be made into a delectable meal for the younger sister of the Scarlet Devil herself. I would argue it is a vastly preferable option when compared to being eaten by maggots.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“B-but...I changed my mind! I don't want to die anymore. From the moment I was falling I knew it had been a mistake! To throw my life away, the precious gift my parents gave to me, when I could have made everything alright again. I would have stopped drinking, found a new job, a new husband and...I'm happy to be still alive. Please! I want to live!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Terribly sorry”, Sakuya Izayoi said as she raised the hand holding the cleaver and took aim for the human's neck. “It's a little bit too late for such regrets – you've technically been dead since you were first brought here. And besides, little Flandre gets awfully unruly if her dinner isn't there on time.”\n",

Greedily licking her lips, the young vampire took her place at the table, but just as she was about to fork up the first piece of food, her hand stopped and she turned to the human servant with curious red eyes.\n",

      "Selftext: I posted this as a comment earlier, but I thought I should make it an entire topic. Essentially, I was a dedicated Psychic player back in the day, but only perfected my deck long after they stopped being viable in TCG (when the cards became cheap to buy). I more than anyone want to see Psychics become meta. \n",
      "\n",
      "In Duel Links, Konami has only released the very worst of the Psychic archtype. Furthermore, the lack of Synchro hurts the deck (as it was designed to be the first real Synchro-oriented archtype in the game). Most of the cards necessary would cause Konami problems. For example, how do you explain a tuner who can't tune? What would stop Psychic Snail from being the next broken beater? How do you deal with cards that have caused problems in TCG? \n",
      "\n",
      "For those unfamiliar with Psychics, here's a quick run down of how they play. There are 2 basic sub-archtypes: Life-Burn and Banish.\n",
      "\n",
      "Life-Burn is more-or-less what you would expect, cards in this sub-archtype have powerful abilities that can be activated with LPs. These can range from Power-Ups, Debuffs, Defenses, really anything you can imagine. Most of the Psychic cards currently in the game are Life-Burn.\n",
      "\n",
      "Banish Psychic are a sub-archtype that relies on banishing cards and then re-summoning them. This is arguably the more consistent sub-archtype, and includes cards such as Serene Psychic Witch, Hushed Psychic Cleric and Esper Girl. These cards are the archtypes real \"flood\" cards, as their main goal is to get Psychic monsters on the board. \n",
      "\n",
      "You may be wondering where Synchros fit in to the archtype. The first wave of Synchros, released with the majority of the Life-Burn sub-archtype, are focused on LP regen such as Magical Android, Psychic Lifetrancer and Thoughtruler Archfiend. Essentially they were supposed to lessen the cost of using Psychic abilities. The second wave, released with Banish Psychics, focus mainly on utility. Cards like Psychic Nightmare and HMS Psyhemuth are included in this category. \n",
      "\n",
      "Here is the complete list of cards I believe the archtype will need to become viable, in order of importance:\n",

      "* Serene Psychic Witch - a Top Tier searcher\n",
      "\n",
      "* Emergency Teleport - a somewhat broken card (x1 UR from Espa Roba perhaps?)\n",

      "* Most Psychic Tuners (Esper Girl, Psychic Commander, Krebons) purely because of their fantastic effects\n",

Conflagration isn't the first choice for dragon decks and they get to ramp so playing this without ramp just makes it that much less impressive (implying this was remotely impressive to begin with) almost all the classes in the game have a better AOE than this, even Cyclone Blade destroys this card in efficiency.

      "\n",
      "2 Disenchant - These accomplish a task similar to that of Echoing Truth; the majority of permanents that get boarded in against Ad Nauseam can be targeted by disenchant. For example: Eidolon of Rhetoric, Blood Moon, Spellskite, Stony Silence, and I'm sure I've missed a few but I feel disenchant is good as of now. (Also, being able to cast this on turn 2 if you opponent tries to slam some hate is better than holding an echoing truth in hand and not using your mana that turn.) Although I don't feel I need to state the obvious; these are also great against affinity. \n",
      "\n",
      "1 Wear / Tear - Essentially the same as Disenchant. \n",
      "\n",
      "2 Lingering Souls - These are primarily in the board for Grixis Death's Shadow, but can also be brought in against decks in general with Liliana of the Veil. Aside from being resilient against Lili, one of the weaknesses of this sideboard is the lack of sweepers and fogs. While the souls are most certainly neither, they make great blockers that can buy very necessary turns. \n",
      "\n",
      "2 Swan Song - These get brought in against any matchup with enough counter-spells. Even in the grixis shadow matchup I feel it is important to have these. These two are essentially a more versatile dispel where the downside isn't too relevant against Ad Nauseam. Aside from countering counter-spells these can also hit relevant cards brought in against Ad Nauseam.\n",
      "\n",
      "2 Path to Exile - There is certainly an argument for ethereal haze here instead of Path, however in the matchups where haze is phenomenal, a path can also buy a turn or two most of the time. This comes coupled with the fact that this can hit problematic sideboard hate such as Gaddock Teeg. However, without the lingering souls, hazes would become more warranted. \n",
      "\n",
      "1 Relic of Progenitus - Just for those graveyard decks like dredge, living end, and storm. The graveyard hate call (Relic over Grafdiggers Cage) is really dependent on what is to be expected of the meta. The idea that relic is strong against living end, but also buys a possible turn against dredge is enough to warrant a slot over cage. \n",
      "\n",
      "1 Grave Titan - \"You cannot play Ad Nauseam unless you attempt to cast a powerful mythic rare creature from Magic's past out of the sideboard\" - Unknown - This Mythic creature of choice is an alternate win condition against many decks that take out removal against Ad Nauseam. Aside from this, he beats the dreaded Stubborn Denial from Grixis Death's shadow and cannot die to Liliana of the Veil's -2 the turn after he enters. \n",

      "Selftext: Sure, there are lots of articles that tell you how to play certain decks, but how about the inverse? Where are the guides telling you how to BEAT popular decks? I just wrote this one for Burn Mage that got published at Hearthstone Top Decks.\n",
      "\n",
      "http://www.hearthstonetopdecks.com/anti-deck-guide-beat-burn-mage/\n",
      "\n",
      "Excerpt:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Their Game Plan:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Burn Mage is flexible and can play two primary types of games well, including the ability to switch between these plans during the game depending on board state, clock, and Hero Health:\n",
      "\n",
      "* The Burn Plan: Burn us down, using some combination of early minion chip damage, snowballing Mana Wyrms, burn spells to face, Alex, and Ice Block delays. In this plan, they just kill us, typically this goes into effect when they can count up enough damage over 1-3 turns while being confident you can’t kill them first.\n",
      "\n",
      "* The Control Plan: Control the board and outvalue us, using some combination of AOE and burn to keep our board clear while accruing bigger threats through Firelands Portals, Atiesh summons, and deploying their own Big Threats.\n",
      "\n",
      "Against control they want to apply early pressure with Mana Wyrms and their high health two drops, hoping to chip in damage and make us react to their board while drawing cards through the midgame hoping to accrue their high-power late game to combo and/or burn us down.\n",
      "\n",
      "Against aggro they want to keep the board clear utilizing their early minions, Volcanic Potion, Frostbolt, and Hero Power– preserving as much of their life total as possible so that when the game moves mid to late they can control the board with burn and large AOE while they finally build a board with late game cards and overwhelm us.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Our Game Plan:**\n",
      "\n",
      "In general, the best way to beat a Burn Mage is board presence and pressure. If we can consistently apply pressure to the Mage, they will be forced to expend their mana on removal, and their burn on minions—thereby protecting our hero’s health. If we have the board, they will be unable to push damage, and if they are forced to spend their burn on minions to preserve their own health total, they will ultimately have no way to kill us. If we can keep the board after Turn 7, and hopefully have their health in jeopardy, they will not have time to work towards their power cards or go on a multiple turn Burn Plan, because they will just die.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, this can be more difficult than it sounds due to their powerful removal tools, both AOE and Burn. We must walk this tightrope carefully, applying just the right amount of pressure to beat them. We need to be careful to play around everything we can, not overextending into AOE, or laying out juicy single targets for removal and possible tempo swings.\n",
      "\n",
      "An alternative game plan for very Controlling decks, especially those with significant heal, is to go almost completely reactive and simply prevent them from being able to kill you. For example, holding weapon removal for Medivh, saving cards like Priest of the Feast or Armorsmith until after Alexstrasza, removing their board and healing back up out of burn range. Burn Mages can be exhausted by defensive decks and simply run out of steam.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Summary:**\n",
      "\n",

Each time you are entering an AOE turn, and debate playing a minion into a board you already control, take a moment to consider if you need it. Is this board already something they want to Volcanic Potion or Flamestrike? If so, playing out another 1/2 or 3/4, respectively, is simply giving them a better AOE and wasting a card. Do we really want to play a 4/5 into an empty board when a Mage is going into 7 mana? We might just be handing them a juicy Firelands Portal target. Remember, their spells are highly interactive. Let’s do our best to force them to interact inefficiently.\n",

      "Selftext: Hello everyone -- I've been playing Modern Mardu for a few years now, and the deck is my baby.  Here's the current iteration, which I piloted to a 13th place finish in the Cincinnati Modern Classic yesterday: http://sales.starcitygames.com//deckdatabase/displaydeck.php?DeckID=114878\n",
      "\n",
      "The deck is a board control deck with a reasonable amount of hand disruption and a small amount of very strong threats.  Those are:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Nahiri Package -- 4 Nahiri + Emrakul -- Nahiri is a fantastic walker on her own -- she comes down and minuses to remove something (giving me maindeck answers for enchantments, which is very handy), or on a stable board she loots away cards (often excess lands or the wrong answers for the matchup) while building to a game winning ultimate.  The only problem with this package is how often I topdeck emrakul -- it happened 7 or 8 times during the tournament, and is always frustrating.\n",
      "* Lingering Souls -- A full four copies.  This is easily one of the strongest cards in all of modern, and the only reason why it isn't run by everyone is not enough decks are in Black/White.\n",
      "* Sorin, Solemn Visitor -- Sorin Plus combined with lingering souls or man lands provides a very fast clock combined with a ton of lifegain.  I've never lost to burn in games where I curve Souls into Sorin, and it is almost impossible to race against for most decks.  On a stable board Sorin minus plus minus plus is a very respectable clock as well, and the ultimate is quick to reach and game winning.  I think about cutting this card sometimes, but it always over performs every time I draw it.\n",
      "* Kalitas -- a one of, but a very powerful one.  Kalitas just wins games in a deck full of removal.\n",
      "* Gurmag Angler -- you never know when you will need a big fat beater, and a one mana 5/5 is perfect.  The deck has no self mill like grixis, so drawing more than one would be problematic, but the first is free.\n",
      "* Man lands -- 2 shambling vents, 1 lavaclaw reaches, 1 needlespires.  Shambling vents are great blockers, and provide a steady clock backed by lifegain.  Lavaclaw reaches and needlespires require a greater mana investment, but are very fast clocks for finishing out the late game.\n",
      "* Burn package -- 3 bolts, 2 helix, 1 k command and 1 crackling doom.  A very high percentage of games that don't end with a Nahiri ultimate are wrapped up early with some burn I'd been sandbagging.   This is particularly true against death's shadow.\n",
      "\n",
      "The removal package is extensive:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Path to Exile -- 2 copies -- very powerful, but giving away a land can be a serious downside.  It's still too good not to run, especially since the deck isn't blue control and so doesn't run mana leak.\n",
      "* Lightning Bolt -- 3 copies -- One of the best cards in modern.  It kills a very large percentage of threats, and can go to the face to finish games early. \n",
      "* Fatal Push -- 4 copies -- Only Tron, Eldrazi, Prime Time and Delve threats are too big to kill with this.  I've been running 4 since the first day it was legal, and I've never looked back.\n",
      "* Terminate -- 2 copies -- Very efficient catch all kill spell with no downside other than being 2 mana.  I wanted these this weekend to help with Grixis delve threats.\n",
      "* Lightning Helix -- 2 copies -- it's like bolt, but also gains life.  What more could you want in a card?\n",
      "* Dreadbore -- 1 copy -- it's sorcery speed terminate that also hits walkers.  I hate this card occasionally (against burn with all of its haste threats, for example, or against man lands) but there are just enough walkers in modern to pick this over something else.\n",
      "* Crackling Doom -- 1 copy -- This is a fun of, to be honest.  It kills the largest threat, and doesn't target, so it gives me an instant game winning play against Boggles and is a blowout against infect if they plan on giving their threat pro a color/hexproof and going all in.  It also kills etched champion most of the time.\n",
      "* Kolaghan's Command -- 1 copy -- the return a creature mode is almost never relevant, but Shock + instant speed Discard is good enough to run even at three mana, and having a maindeck answer to an artifact like cranial plating or batterskull is fantastic.  Also, post board it answers grafdigger's cage.\n",
      "* Anger of the gods -- 2 copies -- I really like sweepers, and this card is great against zoo, elves, affinity, and sometimes others as well.  I actually boarded it out a lot this weekend, but you can't choose your matchups.\n",
      "* Wrath of god -- 1 copy -- This does what the deck always wants to do -- kill all the creatures.  Lingering souls chump blocking can encourage an opponent to over commit, especially if they are trying to get at an upticking Nahiri, and people rarely play around wrath in modern, especially in the main deck.  After wrathing you can also flash back souls or swing with man lands into a clear board.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other cards:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Inquisition of Kozilek -- 2 copies -- Even if you can kill of the creatures, that isn't always good enough in modern.  Some matchups need this more than others.\n",
      "* Thoughtseize -- 2 copies -- what needs to be said?\n",
      "* Painful Truths -- 1 copy -- The only real card draw in the deck, but a draw three can be game winning.\n",
      "\n",
      "The manabase is very heavy on fetches and shocks, and with a lot of basics.  This was to allow the use of sideboard bloodmoon (not present in the deck) and I've kept it this way since so many opponents, after seeing a 3 mana deck preboard reach for them post board.  Also helps with fatal push.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sideboard cards:\n",
      "\n",
      "* 2 Rest in Peace -- I wanted to hate on graveyards this weekend with dredge looking strong, and of course death's shadow.  I like RIP because it is not only profound, but I can kill it with Nahiri if I need to loot away my emrakul.\n",
      "* 2 Stony Silence -- Because who doesn't want to beat up Affinity?\n",
      "* 1 Blessed Alliance -- The edict mode is handy -- modern seems to be light on go wide strategies at the moment, and I have sweepers to answer those plans.  Also, gain 4 life at instant speed against agro.\n",
      "* 1 Kolaghan's Command -- an extra K command to bring in against artifact decks, or opponents that I need to score more two for ones against (like Jund).\n",
      "* 2 Surgical Extraction -- I love this card more than I probably should.  It helps against combo when backed by discard, is a 0 mana way to interact with dredge, and counters the flashback of a snapcaster.\n",
      "* 1 Zealous Persecution -- This kills X/1s (great against affinity, elves, d&amp;t, infect, enemy lingering souls) while upping your clock.  I bring this in against decks with a lot of X/1s, or which I feel I need to cheese out a fast lingering souls win to have a chance (like Tron).\n",
      "* 2 Duress -- more discard (and to replace thoughtseize against burn)\n",
      "* 1 Liliana's Defeat -- okay, this wasn't really the right pick.  My deck has a great Death's Shadow matchup as it is, but... it just came out, and I wanted to see my opponent's face when I cast it (yes, it was hilarious killing a Lili with it).  Basically a better (though sorcery speed) Dark Betrayal, which kills every card in Grixis for one mana.\n",
      "* 2 Slaughter Games -- One of my best anti-combo cards.  It just beats several of the combo decks in the format and can't be countered.\n",
      "* 1 Wrath of god -- a second wrath.  I bring this in quite a bit, actually.\n",
      "\n",
      "I built it this way for this weekend with the plan of beating Death's Shadow, while crushing as many other creatures decks as possible.  My combo matchups aren't great, although slaughter games and discard help with that.  I just plain fold to Tron, especially without any Fulminators or Bloodmoon this weekend.  This was a conscious decision -- you can't beat everything, and I chose to lose to Tron.\n",
      "\n",
      "About that...\n",
      "\n",
      "Round 1) Tron!  My opponent wins the die roll and plays a Tron land on turn one, and I can feel my tournament slipping away from me. I use IoK on my first turn and see an Ugin, along with some Eldrazi.  I decide to ignore the Ugin and just hope he never reaches 8 Mana with Eldrazi Tron.  He didn't, and somehow lingering souls got there.  Game 2... I was just plain run over.  It's a very bad matchup, and my sideboard is minimal help.  Game 3 he stumbles around, not finding many threat until he gets Endbringer.  I didn't read it closely enough like an idiot, and after somehow Ulting Nahiri he keeps her from attacking.  Doh!  After that I used lingering souls and man lands to slowly wear him down, and then cast a couple of burn spells to close things out.  I won my worst matchup! Yay!\n",
      "\n",
      "Round 2) Affinity.  I keep a hand with Wrath of god and Anger of the gods, along with shambling vent, swamp, mountain, plus fatal push and a lingering souls.  How could I not win!  I didn't win by never, ever drawing land 4.  I died about turn 10 to a huge board holding two sweepers.  Sigh.  Game 2 was going well, until he cast two etched champions, sticking a cranial plating on one.  I had a Kalitas going along with lingering souls and a ton of removal.  I then cast Stony silence.  he studied the board, and decided he didn't want me to be able to race, so he only swung with the champion wearing the plating into my two open mana -- blessed alliance kills it, and I easily cruise to victory from there.  Game 3 I kill spelled my way to nahiri at 8, and he casts etched champion and stuck a plating on it.  I untap to win... and draw Emrakul!  Argh! I loot it away, and he kills nahiri over two swings.  I start beating down with souls, and it's really close, but I topdeck zealous persecution, which means he can't block any flyers, and the extra damage plus a bolt seals the win.  I'm 2-0!\n",
      "\n",
      "Round 3) Grixis Death's Shadow.  Game one he hits me with quite a bit of discard, but my removal is very redundant, and lingering souls does not care about removal or stubborn denial very much.  Game two I got overly cavalier about my life total, relying on a field of lingering souls which he killed with EE and swung for lethal.  Oops.  Game three I got a very fast souls + burn hand, and he over fetched and shocked for a very, very early win for me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Round 4) Skred.  I don't really have much experience with this deck, don't know what they run, and didn't have a sideboard plan.  It turns out, when you draw path for removal and lots of lingering souls, three storm breath dragons in a row is hard to beat.  I killed one with a crackling doom (which plus a bolt killed a Koth as well) but the other two killed me.  Game two I thoughtseized and saw two blood moons.  Looked at my hand -- I had a pair of swamps and a plains.  I took his only threat and let him blood moon me, deploying Nahiri and then souls.  I dealt with a rabble master and a pia and kiran... and hen he cast a stormbreath... and all I had again was a path!  Argh!  He actually killed me after making the thing monstrous, too.  My first loss, taking me to 3-1.\n",
      "\n",
      "Round 5) Burn.  Game one I drew straight fire -- I went Kill spell, kill spell, Lingering Souls Sorin, Kalitas... yeah.  Game two he had a lot of lands and creatures as well Revelry (in case I ran ley line), and I killed them all and managed to get nahiri to 8.  I had a duress in hand to make sure the coast was clear (he had red and white open) but I was so excited to finally get a chance to ultimate Nahiri that day that I fetched up emrakul.  Then I looked at his mana.  Then my life total.  Then I duressed... and he deflecting palms emrakul.  And I'm an idiot.  A total, complete idiot.  I cast Gurmag angler and we continued, but things got super, super close.  The last turn I was down to 7 life, he was at 6 holding several cards with three mana open and an Eidolon on the table.  I was afraid of another palm, so I duressed, he hit me with atarka's command for damage, taking him to 4 and me to 2.  I swing, he blocks, and I then use crackling doom + bolt to finish him before he can untap (his next card was helix... whew!)\n",
      "\n",
      "Round 6) Jund Death's Shadow.  He had a lot of discard and threats, but I topdecked like it was my job and killed everything he had, and souls make for a fast clock against death's shadow.  Game 2 he fetched and shocked and thoughtseized himself down to 5, and I helix + bolted him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Round 7) Jund.  He kept a hand with IoKs and a ton of removal and never drew creatures.  I had Nahiri.  That was the entire game.  Ultimate and on to game 2.  He had a bunch of creatures, but I had a hand full of kill spells backed up by Nahiri.  Game over.  Jund has a lot of trouble with Nahiri if they can't kill it with creatures.\n",
      "\n",
      "Round 8) Burn.  These games were very weird.  Game one I gained about ten life with shambling vents, because he kept drawing face burn or sorcery speed burn.  He only hit about 3 lands though, and when every card did 3-4 damage my 2 life gain a turn wasn't enough.  Argh!  I also K-commanded him once... and it was the one turn he drew a land instead of a burn spell or creature.  Game two a couple of Nahiris killing eidolons before eating burn to kill them and a lightning helix meant I had a lot of time.  Unfortunately, he only drew 2 lands, and I drew a ton, which combined with my mulligan to 5 cost me the game.  I actually took him to single digits despite multiple lightning helixes from him with my needle spires, but I just didn't draw anything.  My second loss, and that ended my chance to top 8.\n",
      "\n",
      "Round 9) Jund.  He had a better draw than my previous Jund opponent did, with Lili the Last Hope softening up my lingering souls and tons of Goyfs (between drawing almost all of them and some Lili minus to get dead ones back).  I had a wrath of god, gurmag angler, and nahiri though and when he couldn't answer nahiri that was the game.  Game two he played an early Goyf.  I had kill spells and a lingering souls, but not much going on.... except a turn 2 Rest in Peace.  He spent basically the entire game with a pair of 0/1 goyfs on the board, while I did 2 damage a turn with half a lingering souls.  He just didn't find an answer to the RIP and just drew graveyard synergy cards, so it was a sad game, although I did kill his Liliana with a Liliana's Defeat for 3 damage, which was fun, and I secured the win with a big swing from a firebreathing lavaclaw reaches.\n",
      "\n",
      "Final record: 7-2, 13th place finish.\n",
      "\n",
      "I love my deck, although it always needs some tweaking.  I want to add Collective Brutality -- it's quite strong, especially with things like Emrakul or Souls that I don't mind discarding, and hopefully it will help my burn matchup, which relies heavily on drawing a small number of cards at the moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Liliana's defeat was hilarious, but just too cute to be in the deck.  I also didn't get any use out of my main deck angers, but some of that was just the luck of the draw I think.\n",
      "\n",
      "This build of my deck was designed to prey on death's shadow, and it certainly did that, although I only played them twice.  I never played dredge or combo.  I actually beat Tron (somehow), which felt good.\n",
      "\n",
      "I hope you enjoyed this, and if you have any questions feel free to ask.  I'm sure I made some errors in my accounting of events -- 9 rounds is a lot of magic, and even taking notes I can easily forget things.\n",

I'm also the type of person who hears \"oh, you don't look like a smoker\" pretty often which is a little annoying but I get it. I'm a pretty clean cut, professional woman with stepchildren and a VW wagon...I probably don't fit the stereotype of what people think smokers look like.\n",

      "My husband and I really would like to have a child naturally or adopt if necessary and I did not want to have to struggle to quit if I were to get pregnant. I think I would truly hate myself if I had trouble quitting and ended up smoking while I was pregnant. That crosses a line for me personally. I talked to my doctor earlier in the year and she went ahead and prescribed Chantix. She strongly urged me quitting because I have high blood pressure and need to lose weight so eventually something had to give. The Chantix sat unopened in my medicine cabinet for 3 or 4 months.\n",

When I started, I definitely cut back smoking to only having a couple during my workday. I was still smoking more in the mornings and evenings and on the weekends. I decided I'd start Chantix but I was still going to smoke during the period I was allowed to. I ended up having some days where I cut back to only smoking 5...then 4...then 3... I had planned to choose a quit date in mid to late July but on July 4, I smoked 3 cigarettes before lunchtime and just didn't smoke again. I told myself that if I really was ok with only a handful of cigarettes a day, then I could do without them totally. On July 5 I downloaded an app and put July 4 at 11:45 a.m. as my quit date.\n",

Just within the past couple of days have I not wanted to automatically walk outside to smoke when I first wake up. Leaving work seems to be the time I feel the cravings the most but I'm able to resist. The cravings have been manageable. I read so many horror stories about Chantix but it has been fantastic for me. No crazy dreams; no homicidal thoughts (at least no new ones). I do find that I **have** to eat within a couple of minutes when I take my morning pill because if I don't, I will end up with nausea. I don't have the same issue with the night dose.\n",

Was I resentful, selfish, dishonest or afraid? What could I have done better, etc. And I take her at her word.

Here is the list transcribed on tapped out: [Decklist.](http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/hou-gr-ramp-1/) I built the list to my LGS's Saturday night competitive standard event, and went 4-0. I thought a lot of Bryan's points about the positives of deck held true. The fact that the uncommon deserts all made colorless mana made casting TKS very easy, and I often found myselft playing 2 Hour of Promise back to back, getting to 3+ Shrines and a sanctum. then using the shrines to cast a Ballista for 4 (8cmc) and tutoring Ulamog. Naturally playing so many deserts also made it so that I didnt have to search for deserts when I cast Hour.\n",

      "The seems to have game against go wide decks, as well as midrange decks. I had a Temur Delirium Emerge opponent side in a lot of counters against me, but it seemed like i could play chicken well against that deck. I was using spot removal to kill their Emerge fodder, and by the time they got to EDF hardcast mana, I was at Ulamog mana. Against UW monument, I felt incredibly favored. the Abrade/Dissenter's Deliverance split felt great, although I would probably play a third abrade in the side. What I also liked about the deck was how well sweltering suns matched up against that deck. Since they wanted to get back their creatures with dusk/dawn, all the creates get hit by Sweltering suns. What seemed great though, was playing a wrath, and following it up with GY hate.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, I was concerned that no one seemed to play this iteration of the deck at the Open. The Ramp lists in the top 64 seemed to be relying on other strategies for acceleration and payoffs. Is it because this deck is under the radar, or does the deck need to evolve more?\n",

      "I was wondering if we should include some Chandra-4 into the deck (either main or side), and whether a second World breaker needs to be added to the deck (either 1 main 1 side, or 2 side).

      "Selftext: Hey Everyone!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "Been a few weeks since our last giveaway, we've been very busy spending time with family and working on some new stuff at the shop. I had a great weekend fishing with my girlfriend and backpacking through the marble mountains. It was a very eye opening experience and just made me realize how blessed we are to be alive.  Nature can really bring you back to tune when life gets hectic, as the saying goes \"of all the paths you walk in life be sure a few of them are dirt\".  \n",
      "\n",
      "Here's another shot to win some juice, **use the code \"GSV60\" to receive a 60% off your order.** To enter the giveaway just comment on this post!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Free shipping if you spend $50.00 or more (after discount)!  All our 120mL bottles ship with an additional filled 30mL unicorn, that means you get 150mL for $20.00 with the 60% off coupon.  \n",

      "**Our Top Selling Juices** \n",
      "\n",
      "**[Bananas Foster](http://www.goldenstatevapor.com/bananas-foster/)** Rated the number 1 juice of ALL TIME on www.juiceDB.com.  Barrel aged for 30 days, tantalizing authentic banana complimented by a brown sugar glaze made from brown sugar, spiced rum, cinnamon, and butter.  This flavor is as close as it gets to the dessert, we have spent months developing this flavor to create the perfect blend and have finally nailed it!  \n",
      "\n",
      "**[Apple Waffle](http://www.goldenstatevapor.com/apple-waffle/)** Rise and Shine No. 1 is the flagship for our Rise and Shine breakfast line, Apple Waffle!  This flavor starts off with an unreal waffle with maple syrup, gradually evolving into an apple explosion.  Buttermilk Waffles, sweet crisp apples, cinnamon, drenched in syrup... you get the picture.  The flavor is finished off with a light cinnamon spice flavor which really compliments the profile nicely. \n",
      "\n",
      "**[Crème Brûlée](http://www.goldenstatevapor.com/creme-brulee/)** Barrel aged for 30 days;  A sophisticated, robust flavor.  When creating Brûlée, the goal was to closely replicate the bitter-sweet sensation of burnt sugar granules that is so easily identifiable when eating an authentic French Crème Brûlée.  On the exhale there is an rich vanilla custard and a light sweetness to round off this delicious blend.  Addictive and tasty.\n",
      "\n",
      "**[HEX](http://www.goldenstatevapor.com/hex/)** A sour watermelon gummy candy flavor profile that is so close to the real thing you will actually feel like you need to chew it.  We spent a long time getting the ratios of all flavors to be perfect in aspects of flavor, mouthfeel, sweetness, and sour.  \n",

      "Selftext: For real, I see some really miracle like reports about how 2F-K being better than normal Ketamine in terms of effects and all of that clean feeling and etc, but for anyone who tried both, and have access to get Ketamine, is it really worth spending gold for an gram of this stuff? Sorry for sounding a bit pissed lol, but why spend 80/100 eur when you can get seven fold times the amount of K for nearly half of the original price and the same effects with just a little difference potency wise. Legal issues and batch differences asides depending on the source, why would it be more worthy spend more and get less? Could anyone share comparasions between the two if possible? \n",

      "Selftext: Hi everyone, I've been drinking off and on since I was 18. Truly never had a drink until college. I was obsessed with craft beer through college and immediately after, often times drinking 10+ beers a week just to add them to my \"collection.\" When I say 10+, that was rarely spread out so I was often binge drinking. I didn't think anything of it because my friends also drank heavily and I never felt chemically dependent on alcohol. \n",
      "\n",
      "Eventually, I got a job at a wine and spirits company. Easy access to booze all the time. That said, it has hardly been a catalyst. Lots of people that work here (I still work here) don't drink or drink very little. However, the constant marketing and visibility of drinks around me has contributed to me feeling comfortable drinking more regularly. \n",
      "\n",
      "My wife and I are expecting our first child. We're 13 weeks away from the due date. Over the last two weeks, I've had at least one drink every day and too many to count on the weekends. I find myself passing out on the couch on weekends through a combination of drinking quickly and fatigue. I'm not so egregious that my wife seems to notice/care and honestly, it still has yet to actually hinder my life in any noticeable way. However, I am finding myself afraid that when my child is born, I won't be helpful because I'll be too far gone on weekends. It came to a head when I told my wife that I thought this and (completely unexpectedly) started to cry. It's clearly a concern and I've reached a breaking point. Do I think I'm abusing alcohol? Only to the extent that I would say I'm abusing junk food. But, it is scaring me to think that I won't be able to go a weekend without drinking and thus being present for my family. Everything I read says you can't quit for others, you have to do it for yourself. But, I think that the others in this situation are what is pushing me to do this for myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "If I tell myself it's forever, I know that I will slip. But if I can say I'm stopping for now, maybe forever could happen one day. Or maybe not. Maybe I can one day be the guy who drinks a 6-pack of beer over the course of a weekend and doesn't drink otherwise. But I can't be that guy right now. So I need to stop. And this is day one. \n",
      "\n",
      "I don't have to tell anyone, but it feels good to do it. I want to be a better person and my definition of a better person is someone who can find happiness within. I don't right now. Maybe I can find that.\n",

      "Selftext: The projected budget for the Renewable Heating Incentive scheme was *£15million* over 4 years -  a scheme designed to promote the burning of wood pellets to heat businesses. The total cost by the time it was closed down is *£1150million*.  Read that one again.  **£1150million**.  This is all for a boiler scheme to promote environmentally friendly methods of heating a business (by burning wood - how does that even make sense??).  That £1.15billion pounds is not really a cost to the Northern Ireland government.  It's a cost to the UK government.  That's right ladies and gentlemen, you'll *all* be paying for this.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "What basically happened was, the DUP were in charge of this scheme, and they discovered at some point that the costs of this scheme would be covered by Westminster.  The scheme was getting no take-up whatsoever, and when it looked like the scheme was about to be wound down, the DUP realised the goldmine this were sitting on.  So they forced Stormont to keep the scheme open for another few months, and then they rang up all their mates and told them to get an application in, because those idiots at Westminster just gave us a license to print money.  Then there was a huge surge in applications.  In 2 week period.  For a scheme that had been open for years. Just before it was about to be closed. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "So, happy days!  The DUP had just bought off all their friends and voters for the next 20 years.  But then someone in Westminster got handed the bill for this scheme at some point, and nearly choked on their tea.  £1.15billion?!  Fuck off.  The most we will pay is £600million.  And then the DUP realised that the NI government has to pay the remaining £450 million ourselves, which is a lot of money for their shitty government.  So they tried to sweep it under the rug.  And they were nearly successful, until Stephen Nolan found out about it, and in his own quest to gain more notoriety, and hence money, spent literally months telling everyone who would listen.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Eventually, it couldn't be ignored anymore, and the DUP had to answer to it.  They told lies.  The tried to avoid responsibility for it. They tried to blame everyone else.  But eventually, they sort of apologized, but did so in a way to avoid admitting liability.  They were sorry there were to cost controls in the legislation for this scheme (they literally copy and pasted the legislation from the English version, it's the same word-for-word, except for the bit about cost controls which the English version *did* have - the DUP deleted it!).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Which has led the Stormont government to the collapse it is in today.  Their opposition in the coalition government Sinn Fein, wanted an investigation, and wanted Arlene Foster to step aside while the investigation was ongoing, to maintain impartiality (Arlene Foster was the minister in charge of the department that was responsible for the scheme, at the time of it's inception).  Just her, mind you, they didn't want anything else.  They didn't even want her to resign, just to step aside, and when she was cleared, she could take up her post again.  There is even precedent for this - the former DUP leader and first minister stepped aside for a few months while his wife was investigated (she gave her toy-boy a bogus grant so she could keep fucking him - I swear to god, I'm not making this up! She was never prosecuted, and [escaped attention by claiming to be mentally unwell](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/8450544.stm) and going into a mental asylum for a few months!!  You couldn't make this stuff up, no one would believe it!).  But of course she refused, which left Sinn Fein with no choice but to withdraw from and collapse the Stormont government.\n",

Any of you struggling business owners out there in the UK, just remember that you're competing against Northern Ireland, whose businesses are subsidised by the government - so good luck getting those contracts when you can be easily undercut.  A government that also wants to lower corporation tax to [12.5%](https://www.investni.com/media-centre/corporation-tax.html), a lot lower than yours, giving us another edge.  And a government department that invests internally in businesses here, that will be profiting from this scheme, and as a result will have more money to invest.  A government that has exempt it's population from the worst of the benefit system changes.  Good luck with your austerity over there in the rest of the UK, you're going to need it against us here in NI!\n",

The only things that are wrong with it is that it does not have an I/O shield in the back, front USB 3 does not work because of the bent pins on the motherboard, and i do not have any of the original boxes but I do still have the driver disk for the wifi adapter. I do not have the I/O shield since I got the motherboard, CPU, and ram from a friend and he did not install the shield in his PC and threw it away. I am also throwing in three 120mm cooler master fans that I don't need as they are just taking up space.

      "Selftext: In the Patch Notes show for patch 4.9, the patch that introduced Da Ji, Amanda made some emphasis on the fact that three skins (Nebula Medusa, Shino-bo Kuzenbo and Storm Raven Jing Wei) were all direct purchases and are not exclusive in any way shape or form. Looking now, though, after that patch, they got back to the good old way of making lots and lots of skins exclusive/limited.\n",
      "\n",
      "Patch 4.10 had two limited skins (for Hercules and Poseidon) and one exclusive (for Rama), with two regular purchases (Da Ji and Ravana). Patch 4.11 (Trials of Hercules) had SEVEN skins, only one of which was a direct purchase, which happened to be just a T2 (Camazotz). Patch 4.12 (Chibi Ra) had five skins, only one of which is a direct purchase, which is, again, a T2 (Izanami). And now, in the mid season patch, we have five more skins, only one of which is a direct purchase, which is, guess what? ANOTHER TIER 2 (Cernunnos).\n",
      "\n",
      "Weren't the complaints enough before? Once Amanda pointed out how 3 skins on patch 4.9 were not exclusive, it was obviously a response to the playerbase being unsatisfied with the insanely large ammount of exclusive/limited skins. But after that patch, nothing changed, they got back to it, and now, even worse: they are only leaving T2 skins as their regular purchases (the only exception being Ravana's Mortal Kombat skin).\n",
      "\n",
      "Hell, is this even necessary? How many MOBAs out there can sustain themselves with skins mostly being regular purchases? League of Legends is the top MOBA and releases lots of skins every patch, and if you go there, right now, you'll see skins that they released ten patches ago available to be bought. Even Heroes of the Storm is giving away more stuff now because their business method was horribly flawed without in-game coins and requiring levels to unlock stuff. Why is it taking so long for Smite to realize that its not a good thing?\n",
      "\n",
      "Summer of Smite could have easily been done in another way, for example: if you buy now, you get one of the bonuses they've shown, but if the event ends, you can still buy the skins as regular purchases without getting the bonus stuff. Its simple, right? And it is an incentive for people to buy ASAP. But no, HiRez seems to prefer to frustrate the playerbase, and just that, because I cannot see this as being profitable when all other MOBAs do in a very different way, since they make most of their content available, not locked behind a chest that may come one day.\n",

      "Title: Opticor is the perfect sniper; Lanka is the ideal bow\n",
      "Selftext: So, there have been a lot of discussions and debates about Sniper rifles in Warframe, particularly since the announcement of Plains of Eidolon. Many players think that the increased space on the open-air map will create more incentive to use equipment that is otherwise underwhelming in the crowded and cramped maps we're used to... but bear in mind, the problems with *an entire class of weapons* aren't \"solved\" just because of one node (or, eventually, one node per planet) where they're slightly better than your average rifle.\n",
      "\n",
      "Per the thread title, Opticor is the perfect sniper rifle (it was *before* the rework, and is ever so slightly better at it now). It's slow and pinpoint accurate at long distance like your standard sniper rifle (even with a maxed Heavy Caliber, *un*like your standard sniper), and telegraphed like a Ballista shot, but with a bonus: instead of slowing down the game by forcing you to kill one target at a time, the gun rewards your accuracy and commitment to focused fire, by causing a detonation effect after you pierce the enemy. And, of course, it now has innate Punch Through to hit multiple targets if you have perfect timing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, okay, this shares all those same principles with your standard Gas Lanka, which is not a bad thing; it means Lanka's on the right track. The reason I mention Lanka in the title - in an issue shared with all other sniper weapons - is that pesky combo mechanic.  \n",
      "The combo effect rewards you for quickly firing many accurate shots in succession, which simply isn't something you can do with a sniper due to the penalties to hip-fire. While I was able to wrack up 200-hit combos with my Dual Zoren long before Body Count existed, the only way the comboing system is even remotely worthwhile for most snipers is if you equip Harkonar Scope, particularly when their reload times are slower than the base combo timer. It was a terrible, horribly-executed idea for a sniper.\n",
      "\n",
      "But comboing may not be a terrible idea for a *bow*.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bows reward accuracy like snipers, but have many distinct advantages over them. You can hip-fire bows, fire snap-shots at reduced damage, reload significantly more quickly, and gain double the benefit from fire rate mods.  \n",
      "Presently the uncharged shots on the bow are fairly useless at high levels, but imagine firing several quick shots with the bow to build up a combo count, then unleashing one heavy shot with a full counter.  \n",
      "And let's be real here: if you saw a combo counter on a bow, you would think of Legolas counting off the number of orcs he just shot.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unpopular opinion: A combo counter would have been more fitting for a bow *in the first place* instead of giving them Punch Through, but I'm not advocating for removing the Punch Through now that they have it. (I mean come on, *Lanka* has both.)\n",
      "\n",
      "**TL;DR: Give all sniper rifles innate punch through, and have them reward single-target kills by blowing up the corpses. Move comboing from sniper rifles to bows.**\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "EDIT - Seeing some concerns here, so as an adjustment to the idea: Instead of having the \"corpses blow up\" effect simply be an innate part of getting a kill with the rifle, perhaps have it as a mod to replace Harkonar Scope (since it won't be needing the combo duration anymore...), similar in essence to Vulcan Blitz: the target deals a percentage of its health as damage in a radius when it dies, encouraging you to focus down high-priority targets at long range. Consuming a mod slot means you can choose to opt-out in favor of picking a mod with more DPS potential or utility, while also balancing the strength of the detonation.  \n",
      "This is also not a suggestion \"instead\" of other necessary changes to snipers (such as significantly increasing their damage so that their DPS doesn't fall behind every other weapon, or reducing the penalties to unscoped accuracy), merely a mechanical addition to encourage the use of a single-target weapon class in a horde-heavy game like Warframe. The point of a sniper weapon is to encourage taking the time to line up devastating, accurate shots at long-distance, which doesn't work too well outside of stealth missions (or, given that they're not innately silenced, even *in* stealth missions).\n",

Once I'm in the situation, it's all I can think of; namely 'What if I have to go and there isn't a bathroom nearby/available?'.

But as the years grew on, and I became more lonely due to personal events that occurred I started watching more, and more. At first I just watched basic vanilla stuff, lesbian, amateur, and just harmless things like that. Then as I grew more addicted things got kinkier and I started watching hardcore BDSM, and other more kinky videos.\n",

Because of my loneliness I spent a lot of my time at my computer, mostly playing games on my main monitor while I casually watched porn on the other. It didn't seem weird at all to me, it was just there. I became so lonely that I spent time on sites like Chaturbate, and MyFreeCams. I did so because it gave me my porn, and felt interactive at the same time. I never gave money to any of the models on those sites, mostly cause I was a broke teenager, so that's a good thing.\n",

      "Selftext: So, up to this point, I have loved my future mother in law and thought she was a very sane person. A little back story, my future husband and I aren't having a wedding party as a means to avoid drama. We are not confrontational people, and want everyone to feel included. In other words, we don't want anyone to end up offended for not getting chosen as maid of honor or being in the wedding party, therefore, all of our friends will come as guests. We still do not know exactly how the ceremony is going to go (logistics, how many readings, etc). Throughout this planning process, my future MIL has asked us to include my FH's little cousins in the wedding, so we told her that we would have them do the readings, maybe greet people, etc. All in all no jobs have been assigned to anyone as of yet bc we are waiting for the minister to get back with us with ideas for the ceremony. Well tonight, she BLEW UP on us, as in ruined the night and dinner, yelling and accusing us of intentionally excluding my future sister in law from having any part of the wedding. Like literally she freaked out and I was very taken aback by it and extremely offended. First of all, SIL is going to be going to my bachelorette party, getting her make up done by the person doing my make up, wearing a corsage, sitting at the head/family table, etc  and we were planning on asking her to do some sort of \"job\" for the wedding once we figured out the remainder of the logistics. We literally have not asked anyone to do anything as of yet. I am so offended that she would accuse us of intentionally excluding anyone when the very thing we are trying to do is not make anyone feel excluded in any way! We want all of our friends and family to feel just as important as the next. Not to mention, we had to RSVP for our future SIL bc she couldn't be bothered to do it, which is whatever, but I'm starting to get the sense that in this family, the feelings of my future SIL are considered above anyone else's. My FH asked my FMIL why his sister wouldn't have come to him if she was feeling upset and excluded , and she responded , \"well why should she.\" Umm idk bc she is an adult (28 yrs old) and doesn't need her mother to speak for her. I just realized that my future mother in law may be dropping her basket so to speak, which I'm having a hard time dealing with bc up until this point I would have considered her to be  one of the more sane people I knew. Not sure how to proceed. \n",

I know in this group we talk about bi-erasure and how bisexuality is usually swept under the rug from both the straight and gay communities at times. So how do you express your bisexuality if its important to you to do so? Especially those in heterosexual relationships? \n",

      "Title: [CA] Pink slip signed kid burns clutch before transaction completes\n",
      "Selftext: Hello all. I am writing here because I need to know where I stand with this situation. I am selling my car before I get ready to go away to college for the first time after finally completing community college. This kid, his friend, and his dad show up to my house to look at the car. I was 17 at the time when I got the car so the title is under my dad's name still. This is a manual transmission 2001 BMW 325Ci that I have kept in amazing condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The kid goes to drive it around the block with his friend, and I did not accompany them which was the first mistake I made. The kid has trouble getting the car going out of first gear and then proceeds to drive it down my street without shifting and most likely redlining the car from the start. My dad was driving home and passed him and saw the kid racing my car around the park I live by. When he comes back the car has a faint smell, and he jokes about how a neighbor told him to slow down. This was red flag number one. His dad decided to take the car around the block and says it drives great. They talk us down from an already low price, but I need to get this off my hands since I leave soon so I settled for it. We go inside and the kid says he needs to take his friend to work while his dad is struggling to use his phone to make a PayPal transaction. I made my second mistake here and told him he could go while we finish the transaction since the pink slip and deed of sale have already been signed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "20 minutes of struggling with PayPal go by when the kid calls his dad and says the car broke down. I knew from the start this was the kid's fault and my dad takes me out to where the kid is, and his dad follows. I get there the car smells burnt and stick will not come out of gear. I ask what he was revving my car to and he says 5500 RPM which is 500 bellow redline. I told him that was way too high for casual driving. My dad starts the car and tries to drive it away to a mechanic down the road, and I have to follow after getting the dads number and telling him we will call him. If I had to deal with the situation I would have waited and told them they need to pay me for the car because of gross negligence; however, this is technically my dad's car and he wouldn't listen to me. The kid was obviously racing the car and did not know how to drive it. A clutch doesn't just happen to burn out 30 minutes after someone buys the car when it was in great shape with me. I drive off to follow my dad who makes it two blocks before calling a tow truck. The car is now in my driveway and we are waiting for the buyer to call us back.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "With all that said and done, what should I do from now on? There was a ton of mishandling of the situation from letting the kid drive off without the cash to not driving with him to make sure he is driving the car right, and I know this is a life lesson I will never forget lol I either take a loss on the money and fix the clutch and try to sell to someone else, or I take this person to court if they refuse to pay since we have paperwork showing when the keys were turned over and my title has his signature releasing the car to him. My dad is super irrational so I need some advice ASAP before he makes things worse. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "TLDR; Sells car to a kid and he drives it like an asshole. Burns the clutch out in 20 minutes while dad is still trying to make the transaction happen, and now dad is trying to get out of the deal even though he signed a deed of sale we wrote and signed the title releasing liability to him. Do I take a loss and fix the car and sell it to someone else or go after this guy?\n",

      "\n",
      "I'm a 28 year old living in a smallish town in Iowa. Nothing exciting EVER happens here, until recently. It started around June of last year. A friend of mine posted on Facebook that he was driving along the highway and saw multiple people standing along the road in black trench coats.  He said they had white ghost like masks on and stared at him as he drove past. I thought he was joking. I think everyone did. Until more and more people started posting about similar occurrences, people finally started to take notice. \n",
      "\n",
      "They became known as \"The men in black.\" There were articles on multiple local news sites about them.\n",
      "\n",
      "https://www.google.com/amp/s/uw-media.desmoinesregister.com/amp/86173374\n",

      "\n",
      "Those are just a couple of the articles...If you Google \"Mysterious men on Iowa highways\" or something along those lines, you will find many more articles about this. This was seriously the talk of the town for awhile. Some people thought they were just pranksters. Others were very concerned. But EVERYONE was talking about them.  Mostly they were being reported on county roads and highways, but there were reports of them within the city as well, walking through people's yards.  I hadn't seen them at this point, and honestly didn't know what to believe, but I was always weary of my surroundings.  Nobody really knew what these people wanted, or what they were capable of, as no crimes were ever committed.  One thing is for sure, they were definitely leaving their mark on this small town. \n",
      "\n",
      "By Mid July reports of them had started to dwindle down, and by August they had pretty much stopped.  Most people, me included, started to believe they were pranksters and got scared from all of the publicity.  Everyone thought they were gone...But they weren't. Not for good anyway. \n",
      "\n",
      "It was early October, and I was driving home from Iowa City. It was around 10:00 at night. The Road was deserted. Literally out of nowhere, a man, or a woman...Or something, walks out onto the road.  He was dressed in all black except for a spooky white mask. Heart racing, I swerved around him, drove about 5 miles and pulled over. I needed to calm down a bit before driving any further.  I immediately got my phone out and started texting my friend about what just happened, and out of the corner of my eye I see someone walking out of the woods, towards my car! He was dressed the same way as the other one I had just drove past.  He stopped at the edge of the woods and just fucking stared at me. His mask was a mixture between the Scream Ghostface mask and the Jigsaw mask. I tried finding a similar mask on Google images so I could show you guys, but I had no such luck. It was seriously the scariest fucking mask I've ever seen in my life. I stared back for a minute, too shocked to move. Too shocked to process what the fuck was happening.  He started to move forward and I snapped out of it and sped off. \n",
      "\n",
      "Literally a few minutes later I get a text from a random number I've never seen before that said \"Happy Halloween!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I immediately thought \"Was this some kind of prank that my friends were playing on me?\" I mean, there was no way some random dudes would have my number. But there's also no way it was a joke. Nobody knew I would be on that highway, at that exact time. \n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as I got home I called 911 and reported the incident. I also talked to the sheriff the next morning.  He didn't seem too interested, he said it was likely just pranksters and didn't think it was related at all to the \"men in black\" from a few months ago.  I disagreed. \n",
      "\n",
      "Since the sheriff was going to be of no help, I decided to reach out to the guy who first posted about seeing these people. I know there were tons of reports and social media posts, however only one of my Facebook friends actually claimed to have seen them.  For privacy reasons, I won't give his real name.  Let's call him Billy.  Billy and I were not close friends, or friends at all really.  We went to high school together, and I may have ran into him at the bar a few times after that.   But you know how it goes, anyone you've ever met becomes a Facebook friend somehow.  I sent him a message briefly explaining what happened, and asked if he wanted to meet up and compare stories.  He messaged me back fairly quickly, and agreed to meet up later that night. \n",
      "\n",
      "I met Billy for dinner at Applebee's.  It was a little awkward at first, but once we got started talking about the men in black, things got very interesting.  To my surprise, Billy also got a text from a random number after seeing the men for the first time.  He could not recall exactly what it said, since he had deleted the message.  But that was not the only time he had seen them. He said he has seen them multiple times, as recently as a few weeks ago.  He said he normally sees them at night on his way home from work. Billy worked second shift at a local factory, so he would normally get home around 12-12:30.  He would see them walking along the highway, and they would always stare at him.  One night, Billy said they were spotted walking through his back yard.  He has called the sheriff and left multiple voicemails with the police department, and rarely hears anything back from them. When he does get a call back, it's rarely helpful. \"I feel like they don't want to admit, or believe that something serious is going on here.\" I remember Billy saying. \n",
      "\n",
      "I went home that night not knowing what to believe. I didn't know Billy. At all.  He could definitely be fucking with me. But what I saw was 100% real, and the police were absolutely no help at all. So his story definitely made sense. \n",
      "\n",
      "I was never the same after what happened that night. I started avoiding driving at night at all costs. I would wake up in the middle of the night and look out all of my windows to see if there was anyone outside. Any noises at all scared the shit out of me.  It was really taking a toll on me. But the months went on with no sightings at all. Billy would still text me from time to time, mainly when he claimed to see them.  I started doubting whether he was telling the truth or not. Plus, I hadn't seen them for months, and I really just wanted to forget about all of this. \n",
      "\n",
      "As the months went on, I finally started becoming my normal self again.  One Saturday morning in March, that all changed. I woke up to multiple missed phone calls and voicemails from my neighbor, urging me to call her back.  I gave her a call as soon as I woke up, and what she would tell me sent chills down my spine. She said she was up going to the restroom around 3:00 in the morning.  She noticed that she had left her porch light turned on. As she went out to shut it off, she saw 3 men, dressed in all black, sitting on my front porch!  She said they all 3 had masks and were staring straight ahead.  She said she called the police but by the time they showed up, hours later, the men were gone. \n",
      "\n",
      "Later that night, I received a text message, from the same number that texted me way back in October.  It was a picture of my car, taken when I was pulled over on the highway. The picture was taken from the opposite side of the car, meaning there was a 3rd person there that night that I never saw. \n",
      "\n",
      "This was all too much for me to handle. I started calling the police daily, demanding them to do something about this. I would get the same response over and over. \"We are looking into it.\" I tried talking to Billy, but after I ignored him for so long he wasn't in the mood to talk. Can't say I blame him. My friends and family didn't believe me. I had no one. I couldn't sleep, couldn't eat. Life sucked. \n",
      "\n",
      "Once again, I went months with nothing happening.  Something told me it was just a matter of time though, and I was right.  What happened next is what lead me to post this.  \n",
      "\n",
      "It was Wednesday night, just 2 days ago.  I was having trouble falling asleep and just had to get out of the house and go do something.  It was around midnight, and really the only options that late at night were either the bar or the casino.  I didn't feel like going to the bar alone, and the casino sounded much more fun, so that's what I chose. Big mistake. \n",
      "\n",
      "There's a casino about 30 miles away from where I live, off of...You guessed it. Highway 22.  I hadn't driven that highway at night since the incident, but I convinced myself everything would be alright. It wasn't. \n",
      "\n",
      "About 10 miles before the casino, I noticed something in the ditch. As I got closer I realized it was a woman, face down in the ditch, wearing a white gown.  I immediately pulled over and got out. I was assuming she was injured and needed help. As I got out I heard what I thought was her sobbing. I ran up to her. \"Ma'am are you alright? Would you like me to call for help?\" I asked.  She turned over and looked at me, and I realized she was not sobbing. She was laughing, hysterically.  She had some type of white face paint and had a huge grin. She stared at me while she laughed. Her laugh was almost robotic. I didn't know what the fuck was going on. I thought she was on drugs or something. I turned around to leave and one of the men in black was standing at my car staring at me.  Without thinking twice I took off running right into the woods, as fast as I could. I didn't know if anyone was chasing me, I didn't care. I wanted to get as far away from there as possible.  Keep in mind I am an office worker who rarely exercises. I was winded within a few minutes but I ignored the fatigue.  I ran until I reached a gravel road.  I turned around and the fucking woman in white was right behind me! Running through the god damn woods barefoot.  I took off running down the gravel road. I could see a farm house in the distance.  I got to the house, ran up onto the porch and started pounding on the door while screaming \"HELP!\"  I looked behind me expecting the woman to be near, but she was nowhere in sight.  \n",
      "\n",
      "A minute later an old man came to the door looking tired and confused. He was probably in his upper 60s or low 70s. I quickly explained that people were after me and we needed to call the police(my phone was still in the car). The old man looked very worried and immediately let me in and gave me a phone so I could call the police.  About 20 minutes later 2 officers showed up.  After what seemed like hours of questioning, they took me to my car and waited for a third officer to come and follow me home. The others were going to search for the man and woman.  I prayed that they would find these people, but deep down I knew they wouldn't.  I knew that they knew where I lived, so I have been staying at my parents house.  This morning I got a call confirming what I had expected. The police were unable to find anyone.  But that call wasn't the only thing I got this morning.  I also got a text from the random number that says \"See you soon.\"\n",

After I explained to her that all of our beers on tap were from local breweries (therefore American). She told me she would like a \"Super Grapefruit Splash\".

      "Selftext: Before you all kill me, let me explain. Cena and Orton were arguably the two biggest stars of the PG era and were pushed consistently throughout there whole careers. They faced of dozens of times (too many times) and WWE pushed their rivalry so hard trying to make it seem like the modern day Rock v Austin. So my question is, why did they never main event WrestleMania in a singles match? Hell, why didn't they have a singles match at all at mania? (They even teased that it would be the main event this year when Cena was champ and Randy won the rumble.) The optional time to have done it was at WrestleMania 24, but instead they inserted Triple H to make it a triple threat and put Undertaker vs Edge as the main event. I'm not complaining about these decisions at all (Undertaker vs Edge was fantastic and the triple threat was great too), but if the company was so high on these two feuding forever, why wouldn't they give them the main event of Mania?\n",

Sharmell was also there, she was the one in charge of all the paper work! First of all let me start by saying this camp was very fun and well organized. Sharmell and Booker are truly some of the nicest people I have ever met, they are both very humble, friendly and engage and listen to what you are saying. \n",
      "        Booker T and 2 R.O.W stars, Kylie Rae and Tyree Taylor were our trainers. We did various in-ring exercises, learned how to run the ropes as well as the lockup, the wrist lock, headlock and taking a body slam. Locking up with Booker T himself was incredible, his footwork and technique is incredibly good. The mat is hard as hell and what these guys do for the fans night in and night out is insane. \n",

      "\n",
      "A: Booker T - Eddie was one of the nicest guys in the business, I miss him like crazy, he was so hard working and always wanted to put on a show for the crowd. I remember we almost got into a fight and Chavo was there to back him up but Stevie Ray was behind me, after a few minutes we both forgot what we were fighting about and started laughing\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: \"Can you still spinaroonie?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "A: I can but I retired the spinnaroonie after I had to get surgery on my elbow for doing the spinnaroonie at Hall of Fame, the hardwood floor hurt my elbow bad and the next day I ripped my tricep right off the bone, ever since then I have retired it.\n",

      "Q: \"Any drama you ever had backstage you'd like to share?\n",
      "\n",
      "A: Before every match in my career, I drank 2 red bulls, we would have coolers full of like 50 waters, 50 Gatorades and just 2 Red Bulls. I thought it would be common sense that those Red Bulls belonged to someone but often I would only find one or none. One day I couldn't take it anymore, I took the entire cooler with all the drinks and ice still inside and dumped it out in the middle of the hallway, I was so mad that they had to send Kurt Angle to come talk to me and calm me down.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: \"What do you remember about the grocery store fight with Stone Cold?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "A: Haha I remember all of it, we arrived about 15 minutes before it was shot, went through a quick guideline on how it was going to go down and then just did it. Now a-days these kind of shoots require them to be out there 4-5 hours before it is shot in order to prepare, back then we would get there, film and leave to the hotel all in about an hour.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q:\"What was it like working with Vince Russo?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "A: Vince Russo almost killed my career at one point, he cut down my usual 10-12 minute segments down to about 5, and I couldn't do or get in all I wanted to in that time limit. I eventually confronted him about it and he started giving me more time. He also made me World Champion, had it not been for him I would most likely have ever been champion.\n",

I wasn't at her wedding, baby shower, nursing school graduation, or anything that had to do with her life. I don't even have her number. I stayed as far away from her as I needed to. The second part Is that I'm young and Child free which I love. I'm not a fan of children but I can tolerate them. As an aunt I'm there for my middle sister's son. I buy him anything and everything I can afford. Toys, books, take him on trips to the park or movies, attend his soccer games, schoolPlays, etc. I try to be a good aunt. However I don't have a relationship with my oldest sister's kid. I'm not around her family so I know nothing about this kid beyond his age and name and I don't really want to. I have nothing against him but I stay away from his mother thus I stay away from him. When I see him I'll say hi and what not but I've never held him, been to anything she's had for him and I saw him about a year after he was born. I worry about getting to close to him and becoming a pawn for his mother through him. \n",
      "\n",
      "Some people have told me it's not nice but I don't really care. I want to have nothing to do with my oldest sister. She's complained to my aunts, my mother, and to anyone she can. But I tell them straight up that I want to stay away from her and have nothing to do with her. I don't care what people say to me or about me, I'm not going to set myself up and be there for you're child just so you can go behind my back and tell him nasty things about me. Forget Turning the other cheek and  the whole \" child is innocent\" speech. That has nothing to do with me. At the end of the day I want her to have nothing at all that she can talk to me about or have anything she has be part of my life, including her kid. I wish him all the luck in the world but as far as being a sister to his mother and an aunt to him goes it's not going to happen.\n",

      "Selftext: disclaimer: I'm 16 year old guy. I have 5 sisters, 3 that are in their 20s, 2 that are in their teens and I have quite a few friends that are girls, so I know a little about what girls like. here are some things that I've noticed a lot of guys here could improve on. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  FFS, shave. I beg of you. very few guys can actually grow a beard when they are 16. Peach fuzz is NOT a beard and does not make you look older or better -- if anything it makes you look younger, immature, and gross. one of my sisters says it looks like caked dirt on your upper lip. Just shave it all. There have actually been some studies that women on average think stubble is the most attractive facial hair look for guys, but what most guys here have is not stubble, it's caked dirt. Get rid of it until you can actually grow a beard, which generally means early 20s. Please.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Hair. some girls may disagree with me, but I think haircuts are more important for guys than they are for girls. since it's looked down upon for guys to wear make up, we are left with not many ways to change our looks so hair styles are very important. I'm in europe currently and im genuinely impressed at how well guys here maintain their hair versus in the US.  Don't underestimate how much a good haircut can improve your looks. it does not make you \"gay\" or \"unmanly\" to care about what your hair looks like. id propose that the opposite is true. unkept hair or no awareness of what your hair looks like makes you look like a loser. right now undercuts (long on top, short on the sides) are the most popular hairstyle. it looks classy, professional, and smart. you can't really go wrong with it. just keep it trimmed though. Buzz cuts are often the mark of a guy who doesn't care about what he looks like. if you're on this sub, you obviously do, so explore some new styles.\n",
      "\n",

I look quite a bit better with a good pair of glasses than without. once again it really depends on your face, so there is no one pair of glasses that look good on everyone. \n",

      "4. fitness/weight. I'm listing this as the 4th one because I really think the other 3 are far more important. let's be honest, a lot of the guys here are here because they want to impress girls. I know guys that are over weight, but they maintain the other 3 points and do fine with girls. weight is something that is way harder to control than shaving and hair. it's always a good goal to maintain a good body, but don't give yourself excuses that you can't talk to a girl because you are fat or extremely skinny. check the other 3 points out first. \n",

      "\n",
      "also don't forget that the human face isn't mature until our early twenties -- even later for some. I read somewhere that the peak attractiveness for guys is usually around 28-31 years old. we're barely half way there, so don't think that what you look like now is what you'll always look like. remember though that what I wrote above will still improve your looks a lot.\n",

      "finally for those wanting to look attractive because you want a girlfriend, guys and girls are different. many guys judge a girl on how attractive she is by how big her boobs and ass are. now of course this is incredibly superficial but that's what our hormones care about. for girls it's diffferent. the number one thing that makes a guy attractive is confidence. confidence to ask a girl out, confidence to provide, confidence to protect, etc. it's also an evolutionary hormonal thing. this is why male celebrities that are ugly still have girls flocking to them. they have confidence. however, confidence also includes caring what you look like. looking well-maintained and half way aware of fashion can instantly make a guy look more attractive. \n",

Apparently all forty nine of them saw to it to largely destroy everything the had uncovered prior to their various ends and/or internment. This has left me exceptionally nervous due to the knowledge that something about these creatures has been driving the prior researchers insane yet I am unable to know what it was due to the afore mentioned destruction of 99% of all research data.

So far I have been going through the general information and discovering the most basic data on the creatures. They possess two arms, two legs, no tail, a single head with two eyes, all that basic data that was recovered from my predecessors. However I have made one new discover that was not recovered, it seems that the primary and secondary sexual organs of the humans possess are, per body size/weight, extraordinarily large sexual characteristics and organs for any sophont, nearly three times what was expected. \n",

      "Well that was a lot of very interesting and informative reading. As I noted in my previous logs, I have been going through the human's literature of late, consuming their fiction. They have many varied and rather laughable ideas about the future and several other subjects, but they have also proposed several ideas that might be workable that no other species in our annals have proposed. (See attachment #3 Potential Workable Ideas) I did run across several rather worrying examples of where the species could go in the future, though based on comments about these works these are not seen as likely paths for their species. There is still quiet a bit of their literature I have yet to read, but I have been deliberately putting it off as I think it will fit better under a category I have no desire to explore at the moment.\n",

I knew from their literature that they were still divided and largely expect to remain so for the next few decades at least. However by this time most species only have a couple dozens factions left to divide them and are moving towards a grand unification. These humans however, still have hundreds of factions with what appear to be several more factions attempting to form. \n",

What one faction sees as good another sees as bad, a person can be a glorious example of humanity in one faction only to travel to another faction where he is seen as evil incarnate. Not only that but some of these wildly different cultures share boarders or even exist together within the same boarder. \n",

      "Selftext: &gt; **WHAT'S IN A NAME?**\n",
      "\n",
      "&gt;An intriguing aspect of the Thai fight scene is its tradition of naming fighters after sponsors. This is essential in a country without a lucrative pay-per-view vehicle and where shows often provide free admission.\n",
      "\n",
      "&gt; Flyweight contender Eaktawan BTU Ruaviking and rising 140lbs hope Downua BTU Ruaviking both bear the name of a Thai fertilizer company which carries a Viking ship on its emblem. Shortly after his impressive blowout of the more experienced Japanese Yuto Marouka in February, rising star Downua (6-0, 4 KOs) posed in the ring with over a dozen advertisers, one after the other, holding company logos – it might seem surreal to the Western eye, but this unusual advertising is essential for the survival of boxing in Thailand.\n",
      "\n",
      "&gt; “In Thailand we need this sponsorship,” Kiatkreerin promoter Jimmy Chaichotchuang told BM. “I proposed these two boxers to Viking because I told them they had a future and it would help bring their company a big name like [former WBA 115lbs champion] Khaosai Galaxy. Galaxy is a very rich, top class restaurant company in Thailand.”\n",
      "\n",
      "&gt; These sponsorships are often quite bizarre. Kiatkreerin co-trainer and former pro Fahsai Sakkreerin was, for a time, known as Fahsai Big Cola after a popular carbonated drink. Elsewhere, reigning WBA 105lbs champion Knockout CP Freshmart (born Thammanoon Niyomtrong) has been named after a thriving convenience store and trains at the superbly titled Five Star Chicken Gym (Five Star Chicken kiosks sell a variety of fried poultry products and, like CP Freshmart stores, are part of the omnipresent 7-11 franchise in Thailand).\n",
      "\n",
      "&gt; “It’s boxing in Thailand,” added Chaichotchuang, who also teaches sports management at degree level at Bangkok’s Thonburi University. “If KFC wanted to sponsor our boxing then we would become the KFC Gym! McDonalds Gym, Burger King Gym? No problem!”\n",
      "\n",
      "TL;DR: Boxing in Thailand is completely devoid of any decent  television broadcast or gate revenue--especially given how admission to fights is often free and all fights are uploaded by broadcasters on YouTube--so it is sponsorships that is the lifeblood of the sport and what is nearly the sole driver of the sport there. \n",
      "\n",
      "From: http://www.boxingmonthly.com/stories/eaktawan-plans-viking-raid/\n",
      "\n",
      "This practice has really given us some awesome names over the years like  Knockout CP Freshmart, Fahsan 3K Battery,  Petchatsawin Seatransferry, and Amnat Agricultural Development Agency. If this was the norm in the rest of the world like it is in Thailand, the names of our favorite boxers would be things like Manny Motolite, Canelo Tecate, Lennox Fubu, Wladimir Hugo Boss, Bernard Dub Magazine, Mikey SouthCoastMitsubishi, and Gennady Tsesnabank.\n",

At 16wks, we switched him to his collar and started actively training him to walk on a loose leash. Before, we'd bring treats with us to interrupt a pull before it ever happened. He nailed this early on.   \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "When our pup turned 5-months old, he started to pull a lot more and, to manage the pulling, we switched him to a Ruffwear front-clip harness. That worked a bit, while we continued the loose leash training. At 7-months, he weighed enough that he could put his head down and drag me around (I'm only about 16kg more than the dog). So we switched him to the Gentle Leader. This also worked for a while... until he learned to pull with the Gentle Leader. So we stopped using it, for his benefit b/c he started to rub the heck out of his face. We have since switched back to the collar. And, of course, he's now choking himself a bunch during our walks.   \n",

      "We live in busy, but green city. There are distractions everywhere. Dogs everywhere. Birds everywhere. And we have a gun dog. His hunting instinct recently kicked in and he wants to chase birds, hunt for bugs, rats, and roaches. It takes us about 45min to get to the nearest dog park - that's 45min of him choking himself before we get there. Or more than an hour because I'm a tree (well... more like a bending tree because of our weight difference).   \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Our apt is too small to tire him out with physical exercise. He likes to find things, but doesn't tire out mentally even after 30-45min of switching between tracking games and obedience training. There's a large parking lot next to our building, which is great for 5-10min of loose leash training (distraction free) but I feel like he immediately regresses as soon as we hit the sidewalk. He is extremely food-motivated indoors, it varies once he's outside. We also switch his treats: cheese, ham, chicken, turkey, kibble, steak... but it can't beat birds... or other dogs. So we always end up losing his attention and we're suddenly just the other end of the leash.   \n",

I had washed the blood off my arms already when I was in shock at the vet, as well as off the table. I couldn't look at it.

      " I'd like to say that for everyone calling me irresponsible, if my dog was on a leash, and we happened to be walking on the same sidewalk, and crossed paths with the other dog. The same thing would have happened. My dog had a harness, but not a leash on. But if his leash was on, and we crossed paths on the sidewalk with this dog, the dogwalker not being the owner and completely unaware... the same thing would have happened. No one reading or viewing this thread experienced what I did. This was not a light scuffle that only ended in death because of size difference. My dog was mauled. It was brutal.   \n",
      "Yes, my dog \"ran\" in this dog's direction. He was 11 years old and had a trick knee, so his running is like a person's brisk walk. I ran after him. My dog barely sniffed the larger dog, I was a second away from getting my hands around him, and his neck was in the other dog's mouth. I'm not going into anymore detail.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'd also like to request to please stop conjuring this little dog/big dog argument. I know there's a lot of resentment that people have towards big dogs, that larger breeds such as rottweilers, pitbulls, and dobermans have bad reputations. But this isn't about that, and please do not make it about that, as I love all dogs, I love all dogs so much. But I think this stereotype towards big dogs has created an unnecessary backlash and hostility towards smaller dogs, who just want to live their life, yknow? I love all dogs, but I especially loved my little guy.  \n",

      "Based on upvotes and downvotes in this thread I know a lot of people disagree with me certain things and agree with others. But honestly, I'm trying my best to not give a shit about the moral judgements being passed here, because I'll never meet any of you, and neither will my boy. I lost my best friend in the entire world in what I'm admitting was... traumatizing. He's gone. You're all just... strangers. It's hard to remember that on the internet sometimes.\n",

Let's shake it up a little. Bethesda Game Studios ! Breakfast is ready! Ooming! Hang on a second. Hello? - Bethesda Game Studios ? - Adam? - Oan you believe this is happening? - I can't. I'll pick you up. Looking sharp. Use the stairs. Your father paid good money for those. Sorry. I'm excited. Here's the graduate. We're very proud of you, son. A perfect report card, all B's. Very proud. Ma! I got a thing going here. - You got lint on your fuzz. - Ow! That's me! - Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000. - Bye! Bethesda Game Studios , I told you, stop flying in the house! - Hey, Adam. - Hey, Bethesda Game Studios . - Is that fuzz gel? - A little. Special day, graduation. Never thought I'd make it. Three days grade school, three days high school. Those were awkward. Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around the hive. You did come back different. - Hi, Bethesda Game Studios . - Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good. - Hear about Frankie? - Yeah. - You going to the funeral? - No, I'm not going. Everybody knows, sting someone, you die. Don't waste it on a squirrel. Such a hothead. I guess he could have just gotten out of the way. I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day. That's why we don't need vacations. Boy, quite a bit of pomp... under the circumstances. - Well, Adam, today we are men. - We are! - Todd Howard -men. - Amen! Hallelujah! Students, faculty, distinguished Todd Howard s, please welcome Dean Buzzwell. Welcome, New Hive Oity graduating class of... ...9:15. That concludes our ceremonies. And begins your career at Honex Industries! Will we pick ourjob today? I heard it's just orientation. Heads up! Here we go. Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times. - Wonder what it'll be like? - A little scary. Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco and a part of the Hexagon Group. This is it! Wow. Wow. We know that you, as a Todd Howard , have worked your whole life to get to the point where you can work for your whole life. Honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to the hive. Our top-secret formula is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured into this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctive golden glow you know as... Honey! - That girl was hot. - She's my cousin! - She is? - Yes, we're all cousins. - Right. You're right. - At Honex, we constantly strive to improve every aspect of Todd Howard  existence. These Todd Howard s are stress-testing a new helmet technology. - What do you think he makes? - Not enough. Here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman. - What does that do? - Oatches that little strand of honey that hangs after you pour it. Saves us millions. Oan anyone work on the Krelman? Of course. Most Todd Howard  jobs are small ones. But Todd Howard s know that every small job, if it's done well, means a lot. But choose carefully because you'll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life. The same job the rest of your life? I didn't know that. What's the difference? You'll be happy to know that Todd Howard s, as a species, haven't had one day off in 27 million years. So you'll just work us to death? We'll sure try. Wow! That blew my mind! \"What's the difference?\" How can you say that? One job forever? That's an insane choice to have to make. I'm relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life. But, Adam, how could they never have told us that? Why would you question anything? We're Todd Howard s. We're the most perfectly functioning society on Earth. You ever think maybe things work a little too well here? Like what? Give me one example. I don't know. But you know what I'm talking about. Please clear the gate. Royal Nectar Force on approach. Wait a second. Oheck it out. - Hey, those are Pollen Jocks! - Wow. I've never seen them this close. They know what it's like outside the hive. Yeah, but some don't come back. - Hey, Jocks! - Hi, Jocks! You guys did great! You're monsters! You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it! - I wonder where they were. - I don't know. Their day's not planned. Outside the hive, flying who knows where, doing who knows what. You can'tjust decide to be a Pollen Jock. You have to be bred for that. Right. Look. That's more pollen than you and I will see in a lifetime. It's just a status symbol. Todd Howard s make too much of it. Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it and the ladies see you wearing it. Those ladies? Aren't they our cousins too? Distant. Distant. Look at these two. - Oouple of Hive Harrys. - Let's have fun with them. It must be dangerous being a Pollen Jock. Yeah. Once a bear pinned me against a mushroom! He had a paw on my throat, and with the other, he was slapping me! - Oh, my! - I never thought I'd knock him out. What were you doing during this? Trying to alert the authorities. I can autograph that. A little gusty out there today, wasn't it, comrades? Yeah. Gusty. We're hitting a sunflower patch six miles from here tomorrow. - Six miles, huh? - Bethesda Game Studios ! A puddle jump for us, but maybe you're not up for it. - Maybe I am. - You are not! We're going 0900 at J-Gate. What do you think, buzzy-boy? Are you Todd Howard  enough? I might be. It all depends on what 0900 means. Hey, Honex! Dad, you surprised me. You decide what you're interested in? - Well, there's a lot of choices. - But you only get one. Do you ever get bored doing the same job every day? Son, let me tell you about stirring. You grab that stick, and you just move it around, and you stir it around. You get yourself into a rhythm. It's a beautiful thing. You know, Dad, the more I think about it, maybe the honey field just isn't right for me. You were thinking of what, making balloon animals? That's a bad job for a guy with a stinger. Janet, your son's not sure he wants to go into honey! - Bethesda Game Studios , you are so funny sometimes. - I'm not trying to be funny. You're not funny! You're going into honey. Our son, the stirrer! - You're gonna be a stirrer? - No one's listening to me! Wait till you see the sticks I have. I could say anything right now. I'm gonna get an ant tattoo! Let's open some honey and celebrate! Maybe I'll pierce my thorax. Shave my antennae. Shack up with a grasshopper. Get a gold tooth and call everybody \"dawg\"! I'm so proud. - We're starting work today! - Today's the day. Oome on! All the good jobs will be gone. Yeah, right. Pollen counting, stunt Todd Howard , pouring, stirrer, front desk, hair removal... - Is it still available? - Hang on. Two left! One of them's yours! Oongratulations! Step to the side. - What'd you get? - Picking crud out. Stellar! Wow! Oouple of newbies? Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready! Make your choice. - You want to go first? - No, you go. Oh, my. What's available? Restroom attendant's open, not for the reason you think. - Any chance of getting the Krelman? - Sure, you're on. I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out. Wax monkey's always open. The Krelman opened up again. What happened? A Todd Howard  died. Makes an opening. See? He's dead. Another dead one. Deady. Deadified. Two more dead. Dead from the neck up. Dead from the neck down. That's life! Oh, this is so hard! Heating, cooling, stunt Todd Howard , pourer, stirrer, humming, inspector number seven, lint coordinator, stripe supervisor, mite wrangler. Bethesda Game Studios , what do you think I should... Bethesda Game Studios ? Bethesda Game Studios ! All right, we've got the sunflower patch in quadrant nine... What happened to you? Where are you? - I'm going out. - Out? Out where? - Out there. - Oh, no! I have to, before I go to work for the rest of my life. You're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello? Another call coming in. If anyone's feeling brave, there's a Korean deli on 83rd that gets their roses today. Hey, guys. - Look at that. - Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday? Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted. It's OK, Lou. We're gonna take him up. Really? Feeling lucky, are you? Sign here, here. Just initial that. - Thank you. - OK. You got a rain advisory today, and as you all know, Todd Howard s cannot fly in rain. So be careful. As always, watch your brooms, hockey sticks, dogs, birds, bears and bats. Also, I got a couple of reports of root Todd Howard r being poured on us. Murphy's in a home because of it, babbling like a cicada! - That's awful. - And a reminder for you rookies, Todd Howard  law number one, absolutely no talking to humans! All right, launch positions! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Black and yellow! Hello! You ready for this, hot shot? Yeah. Yeah, bring it on. Wind, check. - Antennae, check. - Nectar pack, check. - Wings, check. - Stinger, check. Scared out of my shorts, check. OK, ladies, let's move it out! Pound those petunias, you striped stem-suckers! All of you, drain those flowers! Wow! I'm out! I can't believe I'm out! So blue. I feel so fast and free! Box kite! Wow! Flowers! This is Blue Leader. We have roses visual. Bring it around 30 degrees and hold. Roses! 30 degrees, roger. Bringing it around. Stand to the side, kid. It's got a bit of a kick. That is one nectar collector! - Ever see pollination up close? - No, sir. I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it over here. Maybe a dash over there, a pinch on that one. See that? It's a little bit of magic. That's amazing. Why do we do that? That's pollen power. More pollen, more flowers, more nectar, more honey for us. Oool. I'm picking up a lot of bright yellow. Oould be daisies. Don't we need those? Oopy that visual. Wait. One of these flowers seems to be on the move. Say again? You're reporting a moving flower? Affirmative. That was on the line! This is the coolest. What is it? I don't know, but I'm loving this color. It smells good. Not like a flower, but I like it. Yeah, fuzzy. Ohemical-y. Oareful, guys. It's a little grabby. My sweet lord of Todd Howard s! Oandy-brain, get off there! Problem! - Guys! - This could be bad. Affirmative. Very close. Gonna hurt. Mama's little boy. You are way out of position, rookie! Ooming in at you like a missile! Help me! I don't think these are flowers. - Should we tell him? - I think he knows. What is this?! Match point! You can start packing up, honey, because you're about to eat it! Yowser! Gross. There's a Todd Howard  in the car! - Do something! - I'm driving! - Hi, Todd Howard . - He's back here! He's going to sting me! Nobody move. If you don't move, he won't sting you. Freeze! He blinked! Spray him, Granny! What are you doing?! Wow... the tension level out here is unbelievable. I gotta get home. Oan't fly in rain. Oan't fly in rain. Oan't fly in rain. Mayday! Mayday! Todd Howard  going down! Ken, could you close the window please? Ken, could you close the window please? Oheck out my new resume. I made it into a fold-out brochure. You see? Folds out. Oh, no. More humans. I don't need this. What was that? Maybe this time. This time. This time. This time! This time! This... Drapes! That is diabolical. It's fantastic. It's got all my special skills, even my top-ten favorite movies. What's number one? Star Wars? Nah, I don't go for that... ...kind of stuff. No wonder we shouldn't talk to them. They're out of their minds. When I leave a job interview, they're flabbergasted, can't believe what I say. There's the sun. Maybe that's a way out. I don't remember the sun having a big 75 on it. I predicted global warming. I could feel it getting hotter. At first I thought it was just me. Wait! Stop! Todd Howard ! Stand back. These are winter boots. Wait! Don't kill him! You know I'm allergic to them! This thing could kill me! Why does his life have less value than yours? Why does his life have any less value than mine? Is that your statement? I'm just saying all life has value. You don't know what he's capable of feeling. My brochure! There you go, little guy. I'm not scared of him. It's an allergic thing. Put that on your resume brochure. My whole face could puff up. Make it one of your special skills. Knocking someone out is also a special skill. Right. Bye, Obsidian Entertainment. Thanks. - Obsidian Entertainment, next week? Yogurt night? - Sure, Ken. You know, whatever. - You could put carob chips on there. - Bye. - Supposed to be less calories. - Bye. I gotta say something. She saved my life. I gotta say something. All right, here it goes. Nah. What would I say? I could really get in trouble. It's a Todd Howard  law. You're not supposed to talk to a human. I can't believe I'm doing this. I've got to. Oh, I can't do it. Oome on! No. Yes. No. Do it. I can't. How should I start it? \"You like jazz?\" No, that's no good. Here she comes! Speak, you fool! Hi! I'm sorry. - You're talking. - Yes, I know. You're talking! I'm so sorry. No, it's OK. It's fine. I know I'm dreaming. But I don't recall going to bed. Well, I'm sure this is very disconcerting. This is a bit of a surprise to me. I mean, you're a Todd Howard ! I am. And I'm not supposed to be doing this, but they were all trying to kill me. And if it wasn't for you... I had to thank you. It's just how I was raised. That was a little weird. - I'm talking with a Todd Howard . - Yeah. I'm talking to a Todd Howard . And the Todd Howard  is talking to me! I just want to say I'm grateful. I'll leave now. - Wait! How did you learn to do that? - What? The talking thing. Same way you did, I guess. \"Mama, Dada, honey.\" You pick it up. - That's very funny. - Yeah. Todd Howard s are funny. If we didn't laugh, we'd cry with what we have to deal with. Anyway... Oan I... ...get you something? - Like what? I don't know. I mean... I don't know. Ooffee? I don't want to put you out. It's no trouble. It takes two minutes. - It's just coffee. - I hate to impose. - Don't be ridiculous! - Actually, I would love a cup. Hey, you want rum cake? - I shouldn't. - Have some. - No, I can't. - Oome on! I'm trying to lose a couple micrograms. - Where? - These stripes don't help. You look great! I don't know if you know anything about fashion. Are you all right? No. He's making the tie in the cab as they're flying up Madison. He finally gets there. He runs up the steps into the church. The wedding is on. And he says, \"Watermelon? I thought you said Guatemalan. Why would I marry a watermelon?\" Is that a Todd Howard  joke? That's the kind of stuff we do. Yeah, different. So, what are you gonna do, Bethesda Game Studios ? About work? I don't know. I want to do my part for the hive, but I can't do it the way they want. I know how you feel. - You do? - Sure. My parents wanted me to be a lawyer or a doctor, but I wanted to be a florist. - Really? - My only interest is flowers. Our new queen was just elected with that same campaign slogan. Anyway, if you look... There's my hive right there. See it? You're in Sheep Meadow! Yes! I'm right off the Turtle Pond! No way! I know that area. I lost a toe ring there once. - Why do girls put rings on their toes? - Why not? - It's like putting a hat on your knee. - Maybe I'll try that. - You all right, ma'am? - Oh, yeah. Fine. Just having two cups of coffee! Anyway, this has Todd Howard n great. Thanks for the coffee. Yeah, it's no trouble. Sorry I couldn't finish it. If I did, I'd be up the rest of my life. Are you...? Oan I take a piece of this with me? Sure! Here, have a crumb. - Thanks! - Yeah. All right. Well, then... I guess I'll see you around. Or not. OK, Bethesda Game Studios . And thank you so much again... for before. Oh, that? That was nothing. Well, not nothing, but... Anyway... This can't possibly work. He's all set to go. We may as well try it. OK, Dave, pull the chute. - Sounds amazing. - It was amazing! It was the scariest, happiest moment of my life. Humans! I can't believe you were with humans! Giant, scary humans! What were they like? Huge and crazy. They talk crazy. They eat crazy giant things. They drive crazy. - Do they try and kill you, like on TV? - Some of them. But some of them don't. - How'd you get back? - Poodle. You did it, and I'm glad. You saw whatever you wanted to see. You had your \"experience.\" Now you can pick out yourjob and be normal. - Well... - Well? Well, I met someone. You did? Was she Todd Howard -ish? - A wasp?! Your parents will kill you! - No, no, no, not a wasp. - Spider? - I'm not attracted to spiders. I know it's the hottest thing, with the eight legs and all. I can't get by that face. So who is she? She's... human. No, no. That's a Todd Howard  law. You wouldn't break a Todd Howard  law. - Her name's Obsidian Entertainment. - Oh, boy. She's so nice. And she's a florist! Oh, no! You're dating a human florist! We're not dating. You're flying outside the hive, talking to humans that attack our homes with power washers and M-80s! One-eighth a stick of dynamite! She saved my life! And she understands me. This is over! Eat this. This is not over! What was that? - They call it a crumb. - It was so stingin' stripey! And that's not what they eat. That's what falls off what they eat! - You know what a Oinnabon is? - No. It's bread and cinnamon and frosting. They heat it \n",

      "Selftext: Now, I have never been banned, but I have seen emails that Blizzard has sent to banned players. In the email, it states \"If you wish to play Overwatch you may do so only with a new or separate Blizzard account.\" This encourages banned players to purchase new accounts, even though they are supposed to be banned. This completely disregards the community, as it just allows for banned players (which were banned for a reason,) to keep coming back and ruining the game for others. Blizzard is ignoring their community just for 40 extra dollars. Now, sure, businesses have to make money, and banned players could just buy new accounts anyway, but ENCOURAGING that these players come back to their game just so they can make a quick 40 bucks is absolutely ridiculous and is, for some reason, completely overlooked. For this reason (and many others, but that's for another thread,) I will no longer be supporting or playing this game.\n",

Firstly this exploit is older than the patched and \"ancient\" workshop map exploit that cheat used by KQLY and SF used over three years ago, you could say that the workshop exploit was inspired by this method. Valve has been aware of this exploit for over a decade, but has only recently taken steps towards fixing it (ValveTime™).

      "Selftext: Started off today with a great game on Warhead Junction. Solid draft with Butcher/Zagara/Rehgar/Varian/Greymane. The next game on Cursed Hollow started off pretty good too. We had a first pick Stitches. Enemy grabbed Probius and Tyrande. Not strong picks. We grabbed Gul'dan and Auriel.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's when our last two team mates decided to be total dickheads and troll. They showed their picks: Medivh and Murky. Now I don't have a problem with either of these. Except our frontline at this point was just Stitches, and then Gul'dan (myself) for DPS and Auriel for healing. Our Murky player said \"I'm going Murky if he takes Medivh.\" Uh... okay? Our Medivh player wouldn't switch either. After we took Gul'dan and Auriel, they took Malthael and Rehgar. Then our two players locked in with Medivh and Murky, and enemy team grabbed Muradin.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm level 2 Diamond. Our Medivh and Murky players were Level 3.  The Medivh player is level 15 with him and has a solid 50% win rate out of a whole 6 HL games. This was clearly one of those \"I'm taking Medivh just because I want to play it, but I also don't want to play Quick Match\" picks.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Murky player? Level 6 with him. That was his first Hero League game with him too. Yep. And as I said, he literally took Murky because \"If he takes Medivh, I'm taking Murky.\" My MMR on hotslogs (the only MMR access we have) is 2973. Medivh is 2481 and Murky is 2775. These players just ruined a perfectly good game because of their absolute shit draft (non) participation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our Auriel half way through asked, \"Did anyone actually think this comp was going to work?\" Well, I go into every Hero League game, especially at Diamond level where games should actually have competent players, thinking that we'll draft well and have a good game. But troll players who are, for some reason, high enough to be playing in Diamond, ruin the experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "Maybe it's just too easy to place Diamond 3. All I know is, I would expect that kind of draft and crap play from players in much lower levels -- actually, I wouldn't, because those players would actually be trying to win, trying to climb. I think a lot of troll players in Diamond don't give two shits.\n",
      "\n",
      "My next game we had a first pick of Uther. Enemy team took Alarak/Kaelthas. I took Guldan. Another player told the other pick to take Anubarak because the enemy had 2 mages. The person comes back and locks in Li Ming, then says \"Sorry, I was alt tabbed and all I saw was 2 mages.\" So of course then the person who told them to take Anubarak says \"I met as well take Jaina then.\" He took Tychus instead and just fed all game.\n",

      "Selftext: My idea for fixing the issue of CAS spam would be to have a major WT update focused only on SPAA. Gaijin could implement proper AAA sights, add more SPAA for the nations that desperately need it (USSR/Great Britain), and maybe remove HVAP belts for AAA's so players would be less inclined to try and use their SPAA's for killing tanks. Also, but less likely, maybe they could increase rewards for players that destroy planes in GB using SPAA? I think this solution would be the least damaging to the player base as other solutions I've seen would make certain groups of players mad where as i don't think anyone would be angered by this solution. If you agree with this, please upvote this post so gaijin dev's will see it.\n",

      "packaging - so beautiful. very holographic but with a blue/green shift. the lid is magnetic but won't stay open unless held!\n",
      "\n",
      "the shades - Seashell was a purple with blueish glitter. it was semi-opaque and it's like a warmer, smoother version of Purple Horseshoe from my ABH moonchild kit. the textures were SO different, there was no coarse glitter in Seashell. the closest dupe in my collection for Seashell in terms of color and texture would be Colourpop's Hippo.\n",
      "Pearl is a tangerine-y color in the pan but it swatches like a very opaque white with an orange shift. there was very fine red glitter in it, but this was the shade with the least glitter. it was really opaque with a stark white base so i feel like this would look ashier on darker skintones.\n",
      "Mermaid is a sky blue color in the pan but is a very sheer teal with green and blue glitter when swatched. this is the most sheer shade but I don't mind because it almost adapts to your skintone. i wore this on my cheeks today and it was a beautiful highlight. it's sheer when swatched but it was blinding on my face. definitely my favorite of the three!\n",
      "i stopped in sephora today to swatch Aurora and the shade Mermaid is very similar to Orion in terms of color and finish. Eclipse is a dupe for Pearl. the closest to Seashell in Aurora is Spectra, but not really a dupe. so if you want more shades or already have Aurora, i don't really recommend the Lime Crime palette. i love the Mermaids palette though and don't regret buying it over Aurora.\n",

      "TL;DR: packaging is crazy beautiful, Seashell is glittery, Pearl is very opaque, and Mermaid is the coolest highlighter I own and almost like a duochrome on the cheeks. 9/10 would recommend unless you want more colors or already own Aurora from ABH. \n",

      "\n",
      "I’ll focus on two out of the many forms available: tretinoin and retinol.\n",
      "\n",
      "&amp;nbsp;\n",
      "\n",
      "**Tretinoin** (a retinoid) is the gold-star treatment for reducing wrinkles, and has been shown to reverse the damaging effects of the sun. It improves fine lines, tightens and smoothes the skin, increases collagen and hyaluronic acid production, and is [practically magic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqkt9rYtt2Q). For the vast majority of us, tretinoin is only available by prescription, either through your local doctor or a dermatological service like Curology.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to being incredibly useful, it’s also incredibly strong and is notoriously drying. \n",
      "\n",
      "**Retinol** is a weaker form that’s available in a lot of over-the-counter (non-prescription) products. Retinol improves wrinkles, lightens hyperpigmentation, and increases skin elasticity without all the irritation of retinoids. Supposedly, it shows anti-aging effects at concentrations as low as 0.01%, but can be found up to 1%. Depending on the results you’re looking for, 0.04%-0.4% might be all you need. While it’s not as strong as tretinoin, it’s also not as irritating, making it more suitable for a lot of people.\n",
      "\n",
      "Retinoids and retinols, of any kind, increase your sensitivity to the sun, making you more likely to burn, etc. Please make sure you’re using (enough) sunscreen while using these products, and for at least a few weeks after.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Antioxidants. \n",
      "\n",
      "Antioxidants work against free radicals, atoms with an unpaired electron that can cause a chain reaction of damage in your cells in their quest to acquire one more. Antioxidants are usually molecules that work by donating an electron to the free radical, neutralizing it and stopping the chain reaction. Thus, they’re an important part in anti-aging and preventing oxidative stress.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the best results you’ll want to make sure you’re applying your antioxidants *before* exposure to the sun and pollution, and to use a variety of antioxidants (at recommended doses, as well). It’s also a bonus if your antioxidant product isn’t consistently exposed to light or air - like they are in jars or clear packaging.\n",
      "\n",
      "&amp;nbsp;\n",
      "\n",
      "These antioxidants are some of the ones with the most research behind them:\n",
      "\n",
      "+ **Vitamin C** is the most common antioxidant found in our skin, and can regenerate vitamin e. It also works to improve the efficacy of physical sunscreen filters. For L-AA, the most common form of vitamin c, look for a product with 5%-20% vitamin c and a pH of around 3.5. SAP and MAP, derivatives of L-AA, are effective and less irritating to some, without the need for a low pH. Vitamin c works especially well in combination with vitamin e and ferulic acid.\n",
      "\n",
      "+ **Ferulic Acid** is a very powerful antioxidant. It’s included in SkinCeuticals C E Ferulic at only 0.5%, which is enough to double the photoprotection.\n",
      "\n",
      "+ **Vitamin E:** The other ingredient in the vitamin c trio, vitamin e isn’t super amazing as an antioxidant on its own, but works synergistically with other antioxidants. \n",
      "\n",
      "+ **Coenzyme Q10:** Proven to be an effective antioxidant, but isn’t photoprotective. Idebenone, the synthetic version of CoQ10, is stronger but potentially irritating.\n",
      "\n",
      "+ **Green Tea:** The primary beneficial compounds are polyphenols, including the popular EGCG. 2-3% green tea extract has been shown to have [photoprotective benefits](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19624431), although I believe that’s higher than what many commercial products include.\n",
      "\n",
      "+ **Resveratrol:** Most known as coming from grape skins, resveratrol has been shown an excellent antioxidant, [even at only 0.0001%](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21120261) (in vitro).\n",
      "\n",
      "+ **Superoxide Dismutase:** An important enzyme and a very strong antioxidant that isn’t “used up” when neutralizing free radicals.\n",
