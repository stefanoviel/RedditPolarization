       " \"Story Sunday: Witnessed an accidental compound dry fire today. I had an interesting experience today that I thought I might share here. Maybe someone will enjoy reading this.\\n\\nMy local club hosts a monthly event where all members are welcome to come enjoy a competitive, yet non-serious shoot. Its called a 720 Handicap, where the handicap is the distance being shot. Everyone starts shooting at 20m and moves backwards once you score 550 on the day. Archers may compete in one of three categories: Recurve, Compound, and Standard (essentially barebow and traditional).\\n\\nWith two ends to go there was amazingly out of place *whack* on the shooting line, some much so that it caught everyone's attention. The compound archer, the only on the day, had had an equipment failure. As the guy pulled the trigger the nock on the arrow split, coming off the string and falling harmlessly out of the bow. The string, though, had been released and completed an accidental dry fire.\\n\\nLuckily no-one was hurt, but the damage to the bow seemed severe.

       " \"I found my brother coconutting I posted this first in r/tifu but it belongs here too.\\n\\nSo I haven't been on Reddit the past week on Reddit this past week, so I had no idea what this coconutting craze was till a few hours ago and everything clicked into place right then. Figured I'd immediately come and recount the story to you guys.\\n\\nThe story unfolds thus. Yesterday morning, Saturday, I popped into work to bring back some work a colleague had left for me to pick up. My parents are currently off on a trip by themselves, so just me and my 16 year old brother are at home. I figured I could leave him by himself, so off I went to work. It was usually about a 45minute round trip.\\n\\nLeaving a 16 year old boy behind at home alone, you can see where this is going. I usually never go to work on Saturdays and the fact that the roads were pretty free, I was able to go and get back quickly, about half an hour... \\n\\nI come home, open the door and go in. Our house is a three story, we have our rooms all spread apart on the floors. So, apparently someone hadn't heard me come in. \\n\\nI go to my room, leave my work there, and go to my brothers room to tell him I was back and to ask if he wanted any lunch. In hindsight, bad idea, should have knocked or made a loud audible sign that I was there. His door was slightly ajar, so I push it and step in...\\n\\nYeah. I find my naked brother, with his headphones on furiously ramming a fucking _coconut_ staring at his iPad... Who knows what he was watching. \\n\\nHe hears me, looks at me with dead set, deer in the headlights eyes and suddenly grabs his sheet and pulls it over himself while I scramble and close the door. If there ever was a list of sights that a human doesn't ever deserve to see, this is on it. \\n\\nAt the time, I had no fucking idea what to do. Obviously I understood my mistakes. But I couldn't quite comprehend the coconut. Until today, of course. \\n\\nWhen he came out of his room after a few hours, all washed up and dressed, thankfully, we both achieved a mutual telepathic understanding about the situation. I think he went and threw it out. I HOPE HE DID. \\n\\nSo this morning, when I had settled down and started to browse TIFU, it all fell into place. Of course he reads this stuff. I asked him off hand, and he confirmed it.\\n\\n&gt; It was Reddit wasn't it?\\n&gt; Uh.... yeah....\\n\\n&gt; You know I'm going to post this right?\\n&gt; *throws cushion*\\n\\nAnd yeah, that's about it. Thanks, Reddit. Now I have to go and buy a coconut to not get mum asking any awkward questions about how we used coconuts, on _his_ own money of course. And yes he's going to hear no end about this.\\n\\nTL;DR: My brother is alone at home, has read about the coconutting craze, decides to try it for himself. I come home earlier than he expects and discovers him in the holy act.\\n\",\n",

       " \"What do YOU do for fun in EVE? About 10 months ago I’ve tried out the trial (14 days) version of EVE online.  I’ve learned the basics, tried out the game and even enjoyed flying around. Normally I hate MMOs with a passion because most of them feel like a chore/job I have to pay for. The constant, agonizing grind and fanatical addicts playing them just ruined the experience for me. EVE seemed different, no grind, fairly pleasant community, interesting/unique gameplay and FREEDOM. Now I’m planning to return to the game and get my account upgraded, but it was a long time since the trial and I’m still not sure what’s really fun to do in EVE.  \\n\\nSo, I have a question to my fellow capsuleers from reddit. \\n\\n„What do you do for fun in EVE”?\\nYeah, weird question from someone who actually tried the game, but still it was only 14 days and most of that was the tutorial and flying around aimlessly, overwhelmed with the size of the game with no Idea where to go and what to do. \\n\\nBut, as the title says, I’m not interested in what you CAN do but what YOU did/do for fun in EVE. I personally doubt that mining, stock exchange or building ships and selling them is seriously someone’s idea of fun. Also, I’m not interested in some text copied from an EVE Wikipedia or stuff quoted from a guide.\\n\\nI want you to tell me what was your “EVE experience”. Give examples of stuff you guys did in the game that were entertaining, worth doing or maybe even “influenced the game world” as the advertisement stated. I really would like if all you experienced EVE players would tell me: \\nWhat did YOU do for fun? What’s the result? How did you get there?\\nTell me your story so I can know get a good Idea where to go myself.\\n\\nOh, and please, don’t give answers like „It’s a sandbox! You can do EVERYTHING!” because that type of answer usually leaves you doing the opposite and not having fun.\\nIf I can’t make a gargantuan dildo made of Veldspar filled with an army of cackling gremlins and ram it into a space station’s cargo bay while blasting [“The Chainsaw Juggler”](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v25EcnLREh4) through all voice channels\\nthen I wouldn't say I can do “everything”. Although the story of someone trying to do that would be interesting. \\nIt’s a complex game, so I need a little more complex answer than “everything”.\\n\\nEdit:\\n\\nI'm surprised nobody mentioned the scavenging and archaeology part of the game (Aura said something about it in the tutorial... I think). I guess nobody finds it that interesting. I hoped I could make an character in the likes of an Sci-Fi Indiana Jones or something like that. :P\\n\\nThanks for all the responses guys! :D\",\n",

I did my best to reduce my nicotine intake but with Juul being 5% and 3% only, it was hard to step down. I chose to use a Smok nic salt vape and purchased juices that were 25mg/mL (2.5%) or less. This helped a lot but I was still heavily dependent. I stocked up on coils and juice one last time before the pandemic struck and promised myself when it ran out that was it. \\n\\nTo my surprise, a change of scenery and finishing my graduate degree was all I really needed to kick this habit for good. I SWEAR by using nicotine transdermal patches. I happened to buy some 7mg/day back before COVID for a highly discounted price knowing they would help me when I was ready to quit. I didn't even need to start with the 21 or 14 mg patches (step 1 or 2) as using one 7mg patch was perfect for me. I recommend actually wearing it to sleep. I was ASTONISHED that I had virtually no cravings in the morning when I wore the patch.\\n\\nOne day it just came off when I was sleeping and I knew that was it. Transitioning off after about 2 weeks of the patch has been only slightly challenging. I've even consumed alcohol and had cravings, but not having any vape juice or pods left made it extremely bearable. \\n\\nAfter 7 days now with no nicotine I really feel like I can stay off of it for good.

In this ad PcGamer makes a blanked face claims that one of the two main CPU manufacturers is an unquestionable choice for hardcore PC builder. The ad in no way justifies its claim, it makes performance claims without real data or testing methodology and has the level nuance expected of an advertisement.\\n\\nThe real kicker for me is the fact PCGamer, thought publishing ads that make statements on a core element of their own field among other articles is somehow acceptable, it shows a real lack of integrity. If this was a real article written by their staff with methodology, benchmarks, prcing, etc... it might be a different story. [But it looks like this on the site.](https://imgur.com/a/fQ4NURY)\\n\\nThe second part to this is that ads on PCGamer ([according to them](https://www.pcgamer.com/content-funding-on-pc-gamer/)) may be writted directly by advertisers and not their staff. The obfuscation on this makes this all the worse, since the writer is marked only as \"Sponsored\", the only assumption most can make is that HP (the advertiser) wrote this and the editorial staff just let it though.\\n\\nFinally the actual advertisement isn\\'t even about Intel it\\'s about an HP pre-build and laptop, how this went from \"promoting HP computers\" to let\\'s makes unsubtantiated claims baffels me.\\n\\nI also want to make clear, my problem here isn\\'t about if Intel is better or not, if the same argument was made for AMD/Nvidia it would make no difference. The issue here is how PCGamer a publication about PC gaming thought an ad of this type, with this complete lack of transparency is ok to be published to it\\'s readers.\\n\\nAs much as it sometimes doesn\\'t look like it, PcGamer is a serious publication and they need to start acting like it.

       " \"Moderators of /r/creepypms have a falling out with the top mod believing his refusal to add a white male to the team was due to sexism. Half the team quits in protest. This drama has gone under our noses for about a month now, but since some users in /r/drama [partially discovered what happened](https://np.reddit.com/r/Drama/comments/3gkxl3/carcinogens_in_rcreepypms_reach_chernobyl_levels/), a former moderator of /r/creepypms has more info to share on this drama. It's pretty juicy!  \\n\\n---  \\n\\n# Context  \\n\\nI will be quoting, almost verbatim (cleaning up some wording to make things more clear, and including relevant links where appropriate), a time-line of what happened according to one of the former mods:  \\n\\n&gt;**Winter 2014** - /u/NoseFetish becomes a less active mod due to issues in his personal life. He does pop back from time to time to add in new rules/modiquette for mods (for example, the addition of /u/keledones^^1 to track users post history, or a rule that we can’t ban OPs, even if they break the rules. He created a workaround type of ‘shadowban’ on unruly OPs). This created a pretty authoritarian atmosphere for active mods.  \\n\\n#\\n\\n&gt;**Jan-March 2015** – Nose suggests we add new mods. We agree. Mod selection is made from people in the community we see as ‘regulars’ who we usually have a good relationship with, sometimes both on and off Reddit. Applications are invited, and one of our ‘regulars’ (white male) applies. We all want him. Nose goes quiet.   \\n\\n#\\n\\n&gt;**March onwards** – Nose remains quiet. Sometimes popping in with more rule updates (like having to use stock responses to people we banned, no more gifs etc), but still he wouldn’t add new mods. Nose is asked about the new mods but puts it off. Eventually other mods are pretty suspicious about it and confront him, he says he does not want to mod this particular user so he has been putting off adding anyone. Mods who are friends with this user ask why, he doesn’t give an answer.  \\n\\n---\\n\\n# Drama  \\n\\n\\n&gt;Eventually after a few weeks he is pushed to explain he doesn’t trust the user because the user made a ‘not all men’ argument once on creepyPMs when a different user said that they were glad straight men couldn’t message them anymore as they were creepy. We believed his ‘not all men’ argument was justified, it had been a generalization about straight men and according to the rules there is a zero tolerance policy to generalizations about gender or sexuality. Mods believed that the reason Nose wouldn’t mod this user was down to more than this particular occasion, even if Nose wasn’t being upfront. We believed it boiled down to jealousy, because we had a close relationship with this user but we didn’t with Nose and we believed it boiled down to sexism as Nose said he [‘would end up treating him poorly and micromanaging everything he did, probably to point of it becoming super personal and everyone thinking I was a dick’](https://i.imgur.com/ualYida.png) (*Note: green is the user who was denied a mod spot*).

Nose ignored this for two weeks then said he would reply on the third week because he was on vacation. The third week went by and nothing. [A fourth week and he replied to tell us he hadn’t had a chance as he’d had problems at work the week before (not on vacation then?) – but he was still not addressing any of the issues we wanted to talk about.](https://imgur.com/a/fhI8M)  \\n\\n#\\n\\n&gt;At this point, the remaining mods came [**together to make an ultimatum**](https://np.reddit.com/r/creepyPMs/comments/3d4m93/big_changes_coming_to_rcreepypms/) ([**Archive of ultimatum provided by the mods on /r/creepypm^^2**](https://np.reddit.com/r/CreepyPM/comments/3d4tt1/rcreepypms_drama/)) – that he steps down as head mod (remaining as a mod, but letting one or two of the more active mods be the ‘head mod’) due to the lack of time and direction he can give the place, or we’d all leave. Despite no communication for weeks, within minutes of this ultimatum being posted, he de-modded all the mods involved.  \\n\\nAlthough these events are directly what catalyzed the mod team's falling out, the mods had other issues with the top mod, [some of which had been made public](https://np.reddit.com/r/CreepyPM/comments/3d4tt1/rcreepypms_drama/ct20dig):  \\n\\n&gt;[Take a look at this though - this is a screenshot of a guy who came to our modmail after being banned to insult the way some of the mods look.

Now it all looked nice from the outside but the mods found out about the shutdown the same time the users did by people messaging us in modmail. He never said a word. Beyond that it was right after 2 mods had resigned and he kept saying emotions were too high, so while he wasn't explicit that he did it as a timeout for the other mods, it sure as hell felt like one.

       " 'A variety of suggestions, big and small! Advancement! Economy! Traps! Classes! This is a mix of thoughts, suggestions and a sort of wishlist on all things Fortnite. I\\'ve put an excessive amount of time into the game, by myself and with friends and while we\\'re no where near burnt out by any stance there\\'s a lot of little quibbles and definitely a lot of improvements within the game to be made. The grind is about to become real and we\\'re also starting to feel less specialized in our classes, gravitating largely towards a team of all soldiers. I\\'ve tried to organize these by category and I\\'ll try and add to it if anything else comes to mind.\\n\\n\\n**Weapons**\\n\\nThe current state of weapons is all over the place between the recent discoveries of how screwy the leveled bonuses can be to how difficult they can be to maintain if you\\'re playing with lower level friends or doing a lot of base defenses where you aren\\'t accruing resources. I recognize that a huge emphasis has been put on weapon durability but overall it isn\\'t conducive to a fun experience for a number of reasons.\\n\\n* Materials generate a sometimes unnecessary grind, worsened by RNG\\n* Most materials are so abundant as to be pointless, while a scant few are rare\\n* Even rare materials quickly become abundant with enough unfun grinding/farming\\n\\nMy current suggestion would be to get rid of durability on your own weapons that you have blueprints for. You still need to craft it, you still need to level up the blueprints you still need to craft a new one when you level up the blueprints and if you drop the weapon for a friend, durability is now active and that gun will break, but not when it\\'s your own and it hasn\\'t ever left your inventory.\\n\\nAmmo is a hotbutton topic for a lot of people and personally I kinda think it\\'s either you have ammo or you have durability but not both. Overall I\\'d prefer durability go away and ammo stay. I help lower level friends and I don\\'t mind making bullets but I really hate having to be careful with my higher tier weapons since I\\'m basically just burning the higher tier resources by simply being there, but wood, metal and nuts &amp; bolts are always everywhere in great abundance.\\n\\nNow, to deal with the reduction in resources required for continuous upkeep, we change the level-up requirements. Weapon blueprints no longer require schematic XP to improve but instead use materials in large quantities. This is likely to introduce a more front loaded material grind but now you can always have your best weapon and it greatly increases the value of many materials.\\n\\n\\n**Leveling**\\n\\nNow that weapons don\\'t require Schematic XP, what about everything else? Well, basically the same. Survivors need Survivor XP, heroes need Hero XP, Traps need Schematic XP, but no longer will they be awarded in strange, flat values as a reward after each match in a seemingly arbitrary fashion, instead they should come from actions:\\n\\n* Saving people and completing missions gains you Survivor XP\\n* Killing enemies grants you Hero XP\\n* Building and Trap Kills supply Schematic XP\\n\\nAs a result of this change you can focus on what you want to do based on what you want to gain and everything you do becomes a form of progression. If you want to improve your traps, maybe you\\'ll play Constructor awhile and build some kickass bases, for example, and if you need to level your survivors you can work on survivor rescue missions. Additionally, making sure Survivor XP is always awarded means people are always making the most important progress, the one that so many people still don\\'t recognize as important. If they\\'re always gaining the Xp and actually using it, they\\'ll rapidly recognize its value while still being gated by manuals, rain and lightning.\\n\\nThe actual level system would otherwise remain largely unchanged, just how you go about gaining it making gameplay more meaningful than just slogging the stage to get the outlined rewards.\\n\\nSpeaking of rewards...\\n\\n\\n**Rewards**\\n\\nLoot just needs to be better, there\\'s no other way to put it. *At this point I think it might be in Epic\\'s best interest to just tell us straight up if they\\'re willing to change this part of the game or if we\\'re just playing a disguised Gachapon.* This is a VERY, VERY important thing to be forward about because the current coyness is just going to chase away both people who are willing to enter into that kind of system as well as those who aren\\'t. I\\'m personally really not into gambling, I don\\'t mind a grind if the rewards are reasonable and currently they\\'re largely not.\\n\\nAs was outlined in another thread (which I can\\'t find right now, if someone has it let me know so I can link it here), it takes upwards of $200 in pinatas OR 400 days of daily quests *just to advance all survivors to 2-star* and to make it even worse *that\\'s ONLY accounting for manuals*. That\\'s an amount of information fits in a Tweet and it\\'s enough to turn off a vast number of players. So just give them out to some extent.\\n\\nSo, as another sort of wishlist of suggestions on that front: rewards should be relevant and they should be rewarding. These numbers are all tentative suggestions.\\n\\nPinatas remain but let\\'s just give them out in a few forms, firstly as mission rewards, secondly as purchases with in-game currency and thirdly as purchases with vBucks.\\n\\nFor relevancy, let\\'s maintain the timed missions, let\\'s maintain the ability to only get three per day but *make it obvious and apparent that there is a limit and allow players to pass if they don\\'t want to \"spend\" their daily pinatas on that pinata type* and let\\'s give out the currently 350 vBuck Llamas from those.\\n\\nAllow standard Upgrade Llamas to drop from level 5 and 6 chests and include mini-llamas for level 3+. Maybe cap Upgrade Llamas per day separately from the timed missions but not mini-llamas. The cap should probably be no lower than 5. Yeah, that\\'s five bucks out the window but I\\'ll get more on that later.\\n\\nSo now we\\'ve gone from a craptastic pinata every other day to at least one almost every mission, within reason. To offset the apparently large gain, upgrade chances will be reduced or removed from these free llamas. Disappointing but there will be other routes.\\n\\n\\n**Economy**\\n\\nWe\\'re handing out a lot of loot now but we still need to make money. I mentioned before that there should be two currencies, a standard and a premium. What those are, I dunno. Taco Tokens.  Husk Teeth. Llama Cheese. Take your pick. It\\'s not important.\\n\\n5 or 10 Llama Cheeses per rank of chest from 2+ for a maximum of 25-50 per mission. Perhaps increasing with mission level. Something.\\n\\nCurrent vBuck Llama prices are replaced by Llama Cheeses. Or Taco Tokens. QuarDurrrs? 100 QuarDurrrs for an Upgrade Llama, 350 QuarDurrs for a People Llama, etc.. None of these have to be set in stone obviously but I\\'m trying to outline them in as easy to understand terms as possible as well as in an attractive manner.\\n\\nAgain, perhaps too generous? Well let\\'s add in something really successful in a lot of other MMO\\'s, a currency exchange.\\n\\nIn the long run all that matters is that currency is being bought and it\\'s being spent into various sinks. Adding in a currency exchange that allows users to buy and sell vBucks organically, (or inorganically since there\\'s nothing stopping internal currency manipulation through faked purchases/sales or with events that flood or starve the market wink wink nudge nudge) keeps free players interested and paid players interested at the same time. The more diverse the marketplace\\'s content the more both parties are going to want the other parties\\' currency.\\n\\nvBucks can now be spent on a variety of premium Llamas with much higher upgrade rates and better quality drops. You can still buy advancement in more than one way. Further, people *still* need manuals, drops of rain, bottled lightning, etc. (which are currently just as big a gate and render pay2progress meaningless, but this doesn\\'t help the fact that everyone feels like they\\'re going nowhere fast), and the premium Llamas can give those among other things, depending on the type you\\'re buying. Additionally, all premium Llamas are always available, no rotation of anything but perhaps sale pricing. vBucks can also be spent on boosts, account status upgrades, cosmetics, etc.. Free players aren\\'t cut out of *ANYTHING* and players who are willing to spend a lot of money have all the more reason to spend a lot *more* money. Further, free players are indirectly no longer free players.\\n\\n\\n**Traps**\\n\\nRight away, straight out the door: No more uses. Period. Throw it out. Durability will instead impact the durability of the structure you attach the trap to encouraging more liberal use of traps. They attack AND defend.\\n\\nSpike walls probably don\\'t need a cooldown. I mean. Cheese graters don\\'t have cooldowns. Barbed wire doens\\'t have cooldowns, it\\'s kinda silly that they don\\'t just reflect per hit.\\n\\nOverall I do really enjoy traps but I hope that we see more types. I hope that we see trap combinations. Example:\\n\\n* Tar trap: Slows husk movement, coats them in tar and gives them increased fire vulnerability.\\n* Fire spray: shoots a short duration burst of fire, capable of igniting tar drenched husks causing them to take increased damage and burn over time.\\n* Gas Traps: The existing gas trap can now spray the burning husk and the fire causes the gas to combust, creating an explosive AOE of damage all at once as opposed to a hanging gas cloud.\\n\\nStuff like that could be a, no pun intended, blast. Generally though the only real complaints I have with traps is that the uses are largely pointless. I\\'m still learning new ways to use many of them and if I had anything to wish for it would just be more types that could be used in more fun ways together.\\n\\n\\n**Classes**\\n\\nThis is a long one. I have a lot of ideas. Maybe they\\'re bad. I think they sound fun. One of the biggest issues currently is the classes are not well differentiated. Even the ones that are fairly unique can still fill most all roles about as well as any other. On the one hand this makes for a more even early game experience but down the road the desire to specialize, particualrly among groups of friends, just isn\\'t going to be met.\\n\\nFor general changes I agree with many users that Stamina is pointless, we\\'ve already got cooldowns and that\\'s enough. The current stamina cap/regen skills could easily be replaced with cooldown reductions to give a pretty identical overall effect, and, in fact, be even better.\\n\\nAdditionally, the game clearly wants to give each class specializations but never fully commits. Soldier getting bonuses to \\'assault\\' weapons means that if you have an assault weapon bonus, you better be using assault weapons, and Ninjas getting sword bonuses pigeon holes them quite a lot too. Beyond poor RNG, people are basically just going to use those things they have 5 or 10% boost to. You\\'re already railroading them into those roles so the two options are to open up what those bonuses affect and/or make them better to further encourage it. Players are going to use the thing with 10% bonus no matter what and always feel like they could be using something else but they don\\'t want to lose that 10%. Jack up the bonuses and remove all doubt. Some suggestions as follows.\\n\\n**Soldier:**\\nOut of everyone, Soldier is probably sitting the prettiest. They have some excellent abilities and damage output. From what a lot of people have suggested, they may even be the only currently viable endgame character on account of stacking damage bonuses from their Advanced Tactics and Warcry and vulnerability from Kneecapper. Their role, at least from my perspective, is to focus fire on the large mobs and particularly to burn down huskies and mist monsters.To facilitate their frontline fighter status I would give them more tankiness, more survivability and more damage focused on suppressing fire:\\n\\n* Increase max health bonus significantly\\n* Increase passive health regen cap to 50% or more to encourage more recklessness thanks to recoverability\\n* Increase damage bonus significantly from the current 10% based on distance, closer = more\\n* Give an increasing damage bonus based on continuously sustained fire, more bullets = more damage\\n\\n**Constructor:**\\nI don\\'t have as much experience with Constructor as anything else but a lot of that is because they feel meh. I love the IDEA of them and while I do most of the building with my friends I usually play Soldier or Ninja since I feel like I have a lot more impact there and I can still build just as well.\\n\\nIf a constructor is supposed to be the main builder, they should have more impact on building itself with improved building speed/resource cost reduction and a more impactful BASE.\\n\\n* Resource cost reduction should maybe be as high as 10% per star, same with build speed\\n* Base abilities should all be increased, particularly damage reduction\\n* Electrified floor should have percent based damage, 1-3% damage would feel a lot better than, like, 6 damage\\n* Kinetic overload should either have no cooldown or always activate when the cooldown is up, not just on crit\\n* Melee bonus should either be moved entirely from its split between Hardware and Blunt to Just Blunt or \"Heavy\" weapons, i.e., 2 handers\\n* Decoy is super neat. I love it when constructors use it. This isn\\'t a suggestion I just wanted to give that thing and the people who use it Kudos\\n* Improved repair speeds\\n* Shotgun bonuses, they\\'re the last line of defense with their lock, stock and two smoking barrels\\n\\nI don\\'t have the detail or specificity here that I should, if I put more time into them I\\'ll have to update. What\\'s definitely a certainty though is that they should be building much more betterer.\\n\\n**Ninja:**\\nNinja feels amazing early on. Dragon Slash and Poison Cloud are such great space clearers and there\\'s nothing like headshotting a friggin Nest with your shurikens, but as I\\'ve gotten deeper into Plankerton they fell off pretty rapidly and I\\'ve found myself primarily back on Soldier. \\n\\nNinjas need survivability above all else and as a melee combat class they could also stand a risk/reward set of abilities similar to the soldiers\\' outlined a bit above.\\n\\n* Shield regen on kill, either activating the standard shield regen with a cooldown or a secondary, slower cooldown that continues even through damage\\n* No fall damage at all, you\\'re a ninja ffs\\n* Mantis Leap accrues charges with increased number of max charges/speed of generation from pertinent skills\\n* Risk/Reward melee damage bonus that grows with successful melee strikes/kills without taking damage, separate to Assassination\\n* Expend 2 Mantis Leap charges to activate an agro-clearing smoke bomb to help escape, recharge and get back into the combat\\n\\nIn essence, soldier survives through health capacity and distance, constructor survives through shield capacity and distance and Ninja should survive through shield recovery, taking a thousand tiny cuts but never a fatal blow. I\\'ve seen a lot of suggestions for health on hit or on kill but that would either take away far too much risk or be implemented too weak to be useful I imagine.\\n\\n**Outlander:**\\nIt has to be admitted that Outlander is basically worthless right now. You see an outlander on your team and you basically assume they\\'re going to run around jacking all the chests, probably throw a pinata out in the middle of combat and distract everyone into a pickaxing frenzy while your base gets eaten and, additionally,  you\\'re probably going to have to rez them a few times. Outlanders are about staying the hell away from combat and gathering resources so why not encourage that?\\n\\n* Party shares Focused Aquisition, double loot chance for everyone!\\n* A portion of standard wood, stone and metal mined by Outlander is automatically given to EVERYONE, and *DOUBLED* for constructor, now Constructor can build and Outlander can feed\\n* Outlander can see everyone\\'s current resources so they know what to be focusing on to help with the build\\n* Get rid of Charge Fragments, cooldown is sufficient UNLESS you want to have Charge Fragments build charges past the normal maximum\\n* Ranger is neat, give all outlanders some Pistol bonuses, Pistoleer is fitting for them\\n* Sniper rifle bonuses, Outlander is already avoiding the worst of combat and climbing around rooftops and attics, give them reduced dropoff and increased headshot damage with sniper rifles\\n* Successive Headshot damage bonus that builds up\\n\\nOutlanders could be made into an excellent team player everyone would like to have on hand with some of these changes.\\n\\n\\n**Taco Tuesdays**\\n\\nThis sub is really set on defining various days to various activities so that\\'s my contribution. You can\\'t go wrong with Taco Tuesdays. Or Thursdays. Really any alliterative food days. But not Sundae Sundays since you might summon Monster Trucks by accident. Or maybe that\\'s why you *should* have Sundae Sundays...\\n\\n\\n\\n*[Several edits later I think I fixed most of the formatting. Sleep comes soon. Maybe there\\'ll be constructive conversation when I come back!]*\\n\\nMmmm, a whole lot of nothing.\\n\\nWell, one other addition:\\n\\n**Defenders**\\n\\nI understand that prior to one of the last closed betas, Defenders weren\\'t a thing, there were Turrets instead and they were great. I would suggest bringing these back. They can still come in the form of Defenders but functionally, they should probably go back to being useful. Defenders were billed as a way solo players could progress painlessly by having AI support but this is simply not true. They either need to come with their own weapon and ammo, not use ammo or durability on gear you give them or just not be in the game in their current form.',\n",

       " '[Resources] Investigative physics IA sample and advice (long read) A lot of people are writing their IAs or trying to come up with ideas right now, or are about to begin with them in year 2. While my other IAs were relatively poor and received mixed marks, my physics IA received a score of 20, so I thought it might be of some help to current physics students to see what I did, to maximize your own chances of getting high marks.\\n\\nFirst of all, [here\\'s my paper.](https://varden.info/doc.php?id=6) I\\'ll be referring to it at various points below. Secondly, a warning. This is a wall of text. And it\\'s a long one. I can\\'t easily TL;DR it because there are a lot of things to consider.\\n\\n## Getting started\\n\\n**The first part is choosing a topic.** You don\\'t have to, and you shouldn\\'t, try and advance humanity\\'s progress in physics. You\\'re a high school student, and the IB knows that. You need to remember that you\\'re not writing a PhD dissertation, you\\'re just trying to experiment with high school level physics, to explain a phenomenon that you\\'ve observed or something like that. And there are several ways to come up with a topic at that level.\\n\\nThe most important thing when coming up with a topic is doing a topic that motivates you. So look for something that you\\'re actually curious about.\\n\\n- Is there a real life situation that you can connect to? If so, that\\'s great! Try and think about things you\\'ve read about, seen, experienced, heard of, etc. that you\\'re actually curious about. For me, inspiration came from reading [this xkcd what if? article](https://what-if.xkcd.com/71/) by Randall Munroe. xkcd what if?\\n has a lot of crazy physics ideas that could potentially be used for a physics IA, but you should still ask your IA supervisor if the topic you choose is viable - it must be a serious and down to earth idea, after all, and actually *doable* at your level of understanding of physics. The main point, anyway, is that it\\'s a lot easier to write about something you\\'re actually interested in. In particular, it\\'ll help you expand on your topic and explain why things in your procedure did or didn\\'t work.\\n\\n- Look through the syllabus and see if there are any particular topics that interest you. Are you a fan of kinematics? What about thermal physics? Pick your favorites and then look for a research topic that is viable within that subject area.\\n\\nFound yourself a good research question? Awesome! The next part is **writing an introduction**, and if you followed my advice on picking a motivating topic, you\\'re already prepared for this part. You should explain the goal of your investigation first of all, i.e. what you\\'re trying to accomplish. *Why* are you doing your investigation? Put that here. And no, \"because the IB told me to\" or \"because I just needed to come up with a topic\" are not good rationales here. If that\\'s the best you can come up with, you might want to consider finding a better topic. Physics covers a wide range of topics, so you should be able to come up with something that interests you. It might take some time, but it\\'s time well spent. (Make sure you do this early, though. If your deadline is tomorrow, then first of all, don\\'t procrastinate on your *next* IA. You *must* have adequate time left to do your actual investigation and writing the IA *at a comfortable pace*.)\\n\\nDo back up your topic with background information in your introduction, if you have any. I referred to studies showing the optimal temperature to drink hot beverages. But make sure that the background information is relevant, and connect it to your investigation later. Whatever you put there should be there for a reason. Also state your real-world situation here. Bonus points if you can connect this to the background information as well.\\n\\nOnce you feel satisfied with your introduction, go ahead and tick off the following boxes on the requirements list, and put them on your IA:\\n\\n- **Research question.** The one single concise question or sentence that your entire investigation is based on. You can put this *after* the introduction so that you can use the introduction to build up a foundation for the RQ. You should have already explained the goal of the investigation in the introduction anyway. Put the RQ in there as a way to define the scope of your research.\\n\\n- **Variables.** Independent, dependent, and controlled variables. You\\'re trying to see how doing one thing differently changes the outcome/result. The thing you\\'re doing differently is the independent variable and doesn\\'t necessarily have to be numerical (I used different methods of stirring as my ind. variable), but it could be if you want to (e.g. drop height of a ball is a measurable variable).\\n\\nWhile we\\'re doing variables, it\\'s best if you only have one independent variable. That makes things a lot easier for you. A couple other things about variables:\\n\\n- State your dependent variable. If it\\'s not immediately clear how you\\'ll be measuring this variable, make sure to put a note on how you plan to do so.\\n\\n- Controlled variables are anything that can affect your experiment\\'s outcome, that you don\\'t change. (If you think about it, your independent variable is just a controlled variable that you decided to change.) What this is depends a lot on the type of experiment you\\'re doing. If you\\'re doing something in thermal physics, ambient temperature is pretty much certainly a controlled variable. As another example, if you\\'re doing a bouncing ball experiment, the ball itself is very likely a controlled variable, whereas in friction experiments, the coefficient of friction of one or both surfaces may be controlled variables.\\n\\n- If your independent variable is not a numerical value, it might be a good idea to outline the differences between each value, and if the ind. variable is a difference between methods, definitely outline how the method changes (e.g. look at how I explained my variable on page 2). **Explain what you think will happen** when you change the values of your independent variable.\\n\\n**Materials and equipment** must be listed. You don\\'t have to be all fancy with this; a bullet point list will do just fine. However, take special care that if you\\'re using a measurement tool, such as a thermometer or cup, you ***MUST*** state the range and uncertainty of the tool. Otherwise, you **will lose marks**. Whoever reads your IA must gain enough information that he or she can replicate your experiment. If you used a measuring cup with a capacity of 50 ml, but don\\'t state that value, whoever tries to replicate your experiment will scratch their heads when they try to use a 1 liter cup because they didn\\'t know how big it was supposed to be.\\n\\nAre there any **safety risks** associated with your experiment? In kinematics, there probably aren\\'t (at least unless you\\'re using very heavy objects and/or drop things from considerable heights). But in e.g. thermal physics, heat can be dangerous if high enough. If you used any sharp or pointy tools, such as a sharp knife, that could be a safety risk as well. Make sure that if you can identify any risks, you outline them, and also what you did to prevent injuries related to those risks. If there are no safety risks, you can either omit this section, or even better, put it there and just state that there were no known risks associated with the experiment.\\n\\n## The actual science-y part\\n\\nThe procedure itself! You *can* probably choose to be super boring and just write a numbered list of things you did when you performed the experiment, but come on, you can do better than that. Imagine you\\'re publishing this thing in a journal later. Nobody puts numbered steps in a journal. *Write!* You take English as one of your IB subjects so I know you can do this. Be detailed, and structure in a clear way.\\n\\n- Write in **past tense**. You\\'re writing a report, not an instruction manual.\\n- Be **objective** and **avoid personal references** (i.e. don\\'t say \"I filled the cup with water,\" but rather, \"The cup was filled with water.\")\\n- Don\\'t be overly repetitive. Vary your language to make it more exciting to read.\\n- Be detailed. Someone reading your report with no other information about the experiment should be able to replicate what you did.\\n\\nAs for actually *performing* the experiment, there are a few things to keep in mind:\\n\\n- Have enough values for your independent variable. Try and aim for at least five. E.g. five different temperatures, five different altitudes, five different whatever your independent variable (IV) is.\\n- Do enough trials. At least five for each value of your IV. Our teacher pushed us to do 15 trials. You don\\'t necessarily have to do 15, but the more you do, the more likely you are to eliminate random errors in your results.\\n\\nDon\\'t discard any data you collect unless something goes horribly wrong during the trial, or previous data was accidentally lost. If you topple something by accident in a way that makes you have to abort the trial very early, then you can run a new trial to make sure you have enough data. It might be a good idea to make a note about what happened in the report and how you chose to deal with it. If your hard drive crashed causing you to lose your data, then you\\'ll have to collect new data as well. (But please do back your data up. Put it on a memory stick, in the cloud, or email it to yourself. It saves you a lot of pain.)\\n\\nIf you omit data without a good justification for doing so, it may be seen as cherry picking, which is a form of selection bias and confirmation bias. **This is actually very serious. Don\\'t do this.** It\\'s okay if the data didn\\'t align with your expectations for your experiment. You can discuss why in your analysis section and be just fine. The IB isn\\'t evaluating whether your results were what you anticipated them to be. They\\'re evaluating how you performed your experiment and how you handle the results that the experiment provided. Also, never, *ever*, fabricate data.\\n\\n**Cherry picking and fabrication of data are forms of academic dishonesty. If you do this, and you\\'re caught (and trust me, you *will* be caught - examiners are smarter than you think!), you may risk FAILING YOUR ENTIRE DIPLOMA. Just don\\'t. It isn\\'t worth it.**\\n\\n## Results\\n\\nYou\\'re finally done with your experiment! Now you can relax and have fun. Seriously, go take a break. You did a lot of work already, so if you have time for it, relax for a bit. You still have some work to do, but it\\'s mostly theoretical from now on. You\\'re no longer dependent on keeping your controls unchanged, since all the data is safely stored.\\n\\nOk, on to the results. You have to put your raw data onto the report, and no, you can\\'t tuck it away in an appendix to dodge the 12 page limit. If you have a *lot* of data because you used a digital data logger like Logger Pro/Vernier sensors, like I did, then be sensible and cut down on what you put on the report. In my own experiment, I did 15 trials across 6 IV variations and for each of those, I collected one data point per half second for 10 minutes. *That\\'s over 100,000 unique data points.* Yet, my report only contains 180 of them. Why? I averaged all the trials and only listed data points from every 20 seconds instead of every 0.5 seconds. My supervisor had no problem with this at all. (For my chemistry IA, I didn\\'t do this, and initially ended up with 11 pages of raw data. It did *not* end well.)\\n\\nOf course, if you *don\\'t* have pages upon pages of data, then just list all of it. Only cut down on the data if you have excessive amounts of it. If you record data by hand, like a lot of IB students, then I don\\'t see how this could ever realistically become a problem for you. The bottom line is, **include a sensible amount of raw data in your report**. Aim for one page or less.\\n\\nMake sure that you state uncertainties in your data. If you don\\'t do this, you\\'ll lose marks. Don\\'t put the uncertainty behind every single data value in your data table. Put it in the column header instead. That way, the table looks cleaner.\\n\\n**Visualize your data.** How you do this really depends on the type of data you have collected, but chances are that the best way to present your data is through an X/Y scatter plot. Either way, here are some tips:\\n\\n- Try not to take a screenshot of the chart you made in Excel and paste that into Word, if you can avoid it. Just copy the entire chart over directly, if you know how to do it. It probably won\\'t cost you marks if you don\\'t do it, but it\\'ll print much better, and also drastically cut the file size of your submission. IIRC there is a 10 MB limit for digital submissions. Don\\'t go over that limit.\\n\\n- Use error bars. If you\\'re not sure how to add those, do a Google search for it. [Here\\'s the procedure for Excel 2007-2016.](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Add-change-or-remove-error-bars-in-a-chart-e6d12c87-8533-4cd6-a3f5-864049a145f0)\\n\\n- Make sure to clearly label the chart, and add uncertainties.\\n\\nAfter you have *stated* the data, you\\'ll have to **analyze it**. I can\\'t tell you how to do that specifically, since it really depends on what your procedure, data, and research question is. Look for models in physics that can explain your findings and that relate to the topic you\\'re investigating. State formulae, and use them. Also provide at least one sample calculation using each formula. This is to prove that you understand how the formula is used. Pick one data point and run the numbers through the formula.\\n\\n- Excel helps a lot. Learn how to process data in Excel. Don\\'t use a calculator. Excel does everything a calculator does and much more, and also much faster.\\n\\n- Charting your processed data may also be a good idea, depending on what your desired outcome is.\\n\\n- Is something wrong? Adapt your analysis and try to explain what is wrong, and if your analysis doesn\\'t work out the way you wanted, do a different approach. I tried to apply Newton\\'s Law of Cooling to my processed data to find a cooling coefficient, only to find that that didn\\'t work at all. So I changed it and used a reciprocal model instead. Data fit almost perfectly.\\n\\n- Make sure to mention experimental errors here if they affect how you perform your analysis.\\n\\n## The final part\\n\\nBy now you\\'ll have analyzed your experimental data and you\\'re left with a result. Was it what you anticipated? Was it not? Did anything go wrong during the experiment itself? This is where you\\'ll be detailing that, because now it\\'s **conclusion time**.\\n\\nThe conclusion of your report is the final part of your report, it\\'s a summary of what you figured out. Don\\'t go into huge detail about the goal of your experiment here, because that part is already written way up in the introduction.\\n\\nState the answer to your research question, first and foremost. Once that\\'s done, you can elaborate on the results of your experiment vs. your initial expectations of what would happen. That\\'s what the conclusion is for.\\n\\n**State error sources.** Don\\'t forget about this. For every error source, you must:\\n\\n- State the error\\n- State what kind of error it is (systematic or random)\\n- Explain what effect the error had on the data/results\\n- Unless it\\'s immediately obvious, also explain how the error could have been avoided and *if* it should be avoided (chances are that it should be, but if it for some reason shouldn\\'t, specify why avoiding it would be detrimental to the results)\\n\\nFinally, at the very *end* of your report, cite your sources if you used any. You probably did. Put them here. Use a recognized citation style. A lot of schools love MLA. I used APA. If your supervisor tells you to use a specific style, then do that.\\n\\n## Formatting\\n\\nOh, you thought we were done? Not quite! But I promise, we\\'re almost there. The only thing left I want to discuss is usage of formal elements. You are still doing IB English, so there are no excuses for not doing it. Here\\'s a checklist:\\n\\n- **Use page numbers.** I did \"Page X of Y\" centered in the footer of each page. How you do it is up to you. There\\'s a function in Word that does this for you automatically. [Here\\'s how.](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Add-page-numbers-in-Word-9f366518-0500-4b45-903d-987d3827c007)\\n\\n- **Use a legible font.** If you even so much as consider using Comic Sans for your paper then I won\\'t feel sorry for you if you get a poor grade. Good choices are Times New Roman, Arial, Verdana, etc. I used Crimson Text in mine. Anything that would be considered appropriate in an academic journal is 100% fine.\\n\\n- **Use headings.** Word has a nice function to automatically style headings with the click of a button. If you can\\'t figure it out, just write your heading, make it bold, and increase the font size a few notches. Use a title too, on the first page. A cover page shouldn\\'t be necessary.\\n\\n- **Put *something* in the header** on each page. Preferably the title of your investigation. Don\\'t make it too long. I just followed a simple template of \"Physics IA: &lt;my topic here&gt;\". This happens to be my title, too.\\n\\n- **Don\\'t put your name or candidate number anywhere.** All submissions should be anonymous.\\n\\n- **Use 1.5 line spacing.** This really improves readability. Don\\'t try and get away with too much line spacing to artificially inflate your page count. The same goes for font size.\\n\\n- **Listen to your English teacher.** I know this is physics, but your report is a written piece of work. Listen to your physics teacher too, of course, but know that formatting makes a difference.\\n\\n## TL;DR checklist\\n\\n- You\\'re a high school student, not a PhD graduate. Keep your topic at a sensible level of difficulty.\\n- Pick a topic that you\\'re comfortable with.\\n- Having a real life situation to refer to helps a lot.\\n- **Don\\'t procrastinate.** Start early.\\n\\n### Introduction\\n\\n- What your investigation is about\\n- Background information\\n- Real life situation\\n- Why did you choose this topic?\\n\\n### Research question\\n\\n- State this clearly and concisely.\\n\\n### Variables\\n\\n- Independent\\n- Dependent\\n- Controls\\n\\n### Materials and equipment\\n\\n- List everything you used\\n- State capacity/range of measurement tools\\n- State the uncertainties as well\\n\\n### Safety risks\\n\\n- List any potential risks\\n- Explain how you deal with/mitigate them\\n\\n### Procedure\\n\\n- Past tense\\n- Be objective\\n- Don\\'t be repetitive\\n- Details\\n\\n### Performing the experiment\\n\\n- At least five variations of the independent variable\\n- At least five trials for each of these variations\\n- Avoid discarding data\\n- Never fabricate data\\n- Keep backups, keep the data safe\\n\\n### Results\\n\\n- Raw data table(s)\\n- Only include a sensible amount of data (up to ~1 page)\\n- State uncertainties in column headers\\n- Visualize with charts\\n- Use error bars on the charts\\n- Label all charts\\n- Add uncertainties to charts\\n\\n### Data analysis\\n\\n- Explain in detail how you process your data\\n- Justify the way you do this\\n- Charts?\\n- Don\\'t panic if something\\'s wrong, try and explain it in other ways\\n- Experimental errors, if very significant\\n\\n### Conclusion\\n\\n- Answer your research question first\\n- Summary of results\\n- Elaborate on expectations vs. actual results\\n- State experimental errors\\n- State the type of those errors\\n- Explain the effect of errors\\n- Explain how to avoid those errors next time the experiment is performed\\n\\n### Works cited\\n\\n- Reference all cited works\\n- Use an approved/recognized citation style\\n\\n### Formatting\\n\\n- Page numbers\\n- Legible and sensible font\\n- Section headings\\n- Header on every page\\n- Your IA is anonymous\\n- 1.5 line spacing\\n- Listen to advice from others',\n",

So there’s this Knowing brother segment, in which Shindong is the host supposed to sing one song’s rhythm but in another song’s lyrics. And he kind of nailed it effortlessly. Like that is truly impressive.\\n\\nThere’s one time Eunhyuk was hosting as a substitute host for promotion, even though he was pretty decent, you can tell it’s not on Shindong’s level. I mean I’m sure they must have prepared a lot for the segment but it still takes strong senses of music to make it work.\\n\\nAlso there’s this new segment in which Shindong would teach Kang Hodong idols’ choreographies and he is such a great teacher (Hodong is a great student as well.)',\n",

       " 'Here\\'s a few ways to get width and depth in a mix I saw this posted somewhere on the internet a long time ago and I found it helpful. Maybe you guys will find some useful techniques in it too.\\n\\n\\n\\nWays to get width and depth in a mix:\\n\\n\\n\\n1.) Chorus stuff. Try chorusing only one side of a signal. Can be cool with clean electric guitars.\\n\\n\\n\\n2.) Flip a side on a stereo track out of phase, mix in 3-6 db underneath the other side.\\n\\n\\n\\n3.) Haas effect--delay one stereo side on an element or two by 10 milliseconds or so.\\n\\n\\n\\n4.) Make an aux buss with a pitch shifter on it: detune one side by 6-16 percent, and tune up the other side by 6-16 percent. I.e. left is pitchshifted -6 and right +6 percent. Classic trick.\\n\\n\\n\\n5.) Buss a few things to an aux with a delay on it. Go sparingly. Ping pong delay can be fun on high hat.\\n\\n\\n\\n6.) Create an aux buss with a stereo widener on it like Waves S1. Run various stuff to it.\\n\\n\\n\\n7.) Put a flanger or phaser on an aux buss with a panner. Run a few things to it ever so slightly. You shouldn\\'t really hear it, but you should notice when its gone.\\n\\n\\n\\n8.) Create a drum buss, route stuff to it. Put a bit of a room verb on it... now smash it with a limiter. Throw into your mix a little bit.\\n\\n\\n\\n9.) If you are doing primarily sampled drums ala electronic/industrial music try running a mix of the drums to a set of speakers in the live room. Now mic the room in stereo. Add to mix. Fun, fun, fun.\\n\\n\\n\\n10.) Create a buss and run some snare to it. Pitch shift it down an octave. Mix it in a little bit.\\n\\n\\n\\n11.) Put 20 milliseconds of delay on your room mics to make the room feel bigger.\\n\\n\\n\\nAdd some of the above ideas along with proper and judicious use of reverb and your tracks will take on new life and size.\\n\\n\\n\\nIf you need the sounds to have \\'verb but still stay present in the mix you need to pay attention to the following:\\n\\n\\n\\n1.) You\\'re running the \\'verb as an aux buss or send, right? Not inserting it in the track and playing with the wet/dry ratio, right? Also, make sure the verb is 100% wet on the aux buss. That way you get 100% of the dry sound, plus however much \\'verbed sound depending on how much you buss to the aux.\\n\\n\\n\\n2.) Pre-delay is your friend. That gives the dry sound a chance to be heard before the \\'verb cloud starts building up. 20 milliseconds is a good starting point. Anywhere from 10 to 60 milliseconds is common. That will keep things up front, but with ambiance.\\n\\n\\n\\n3.) Brighter \\'verbs feel closer to the listener. Use a shelf or lowpass filter to knock off some top end off the verb. Try a roll off around 3-6 khz for starters. Will move the \\'verb in the background, but let you get some mileage out of it.\\n\\n\\n\\n4.) Time the verb (RT60) to work with the tempo of the song. Works wonders in reducing the sonic clutter.\\n\\n\\n\\n5.) Dampening absorbs high freqs over time, so the front of the \\'verb will be brighter than the tail, making the verb feel more distant. Try that too.\\n\\n\\n\\n6.) Try increasing the low end decay time or shortening the high end. That\\'s how you get huge without being too spitty on top.\\n\\n\\n\\n7.) For percussion the main thing that determines the \"size\" of the space is what\\'s happening on the snare. Maybe less overhead \\'verb and a bit more snare. Heck, multiple \\'verbs on snares work... I\\'ve ran a nonlin, plate and room simultaneously in the past and would do it again. Tweak it right and the snare stays front and center, but is big with a nice decay to it.\\n\\n\\n\\n8.) Setting a balance between early reflections (ER) and the reverb tail is a key to the psychoacoustic distance the listener will perceive. Don\\'t go nuts with the ER\\'s, it can sound a bit weird on many sources and feels closer. Less ER\\'s seem to put things in the distance. However, sometimes it is fun to put a lot of ER on percussion and keep the tail muted a bit. Sounds like shit is bouncin\\' off the walls.',\n",
       " \"Woah... I just realized something. This game has absolutely NO filler. Seriously.  Other open world games like Skyrim, or even unrelated games like GTA, as good as they are, contain filler. BS quests or little minigames to pass the time. Things put in there simply to beef up the game. There's lots to do, but only a certain percentage of that stuff actually matters. \\n\\nBut so far Dark Souls is entirely free of that. Every area is seamlessly tied together, and everything that's available to do always directly impacts something. Everything has meaning and purpose. Even the combat contains no filler, if that's even possible. \\n\\nThis game is like a skillfully cut out clean, solid, consistent experience. Everything always matters. I like that. \\n\\nBONUS NOTE: I also dig the shortcuts. I like how every single area of the game provides a shortcut to another area. So it's a matter of traveling from shortcut to shortcut until you reach the area you want. I love the design of that. \",\n",

       " '2 Points per game Since the midway point of last season I\\'ve been focused on what it would take to achieve 2 points per game by the end of the season. I think 2 ppg is a good bench mark to see how things are going, and by looking ahead at expected points it can help keep things in perspective when we inevitably drop points. \\n\\nI thought I\\'d share my idea here and see what everyone thought. \\n\\nThere\\'s little point in looking too far ahead but also 2 ppg is only relevant when looking at a large enough sample size, so I like to break down the season into quarters, so I\\'ll only be looking at the first 9 games. \\n\\nSaints H\\nCity A\\nSpurs A\\nVilla H\\nWest Ham A\\nEverton H\\nWest Brom H\\nQPR A\\nHull H\\n\\nStarting with the \"easy\" games, we should expect nothing less than 3 points from home matches against lesser opponents. This includes:\\n\\nSaints, Villa, West Brom, and Hull. \\n\\nThat puts us at 12 points already. 6 more to go. \\n\\nQPR away should be another 3 points that any reasonable supporter could expect. That puts us at 15.\\n\\nThat means in the remaining 4 games we only need 3 points. Spurs, West Ham and Everton could all be draws, and a loss away to Man City would do it. \\n\\nOf course I actually expect to get more than 3 points from these 4 games but this keeps things in perspective for me. Any points above what I\\'ve predicted are bonus IMO, and can be used to balance out the points when we unexpectedly drop points in the aforementioned \"easy\" matches. \\n\\nLooking at these results more closely, I\\'m implying that we could go with only 2 wins in our opening 6 games and I\\'d see no reason to panic. \\n\\nIf we can shoot above 2 ppg this season that would be great. I\\'d love to see us break 80 points (about 2.1 ppg) but 76 (2 ppg) would practically guarantee us top 4. \\n',\n",

       " \"My mum venomously hates me because my SO has not lost enough weight - and is now heavily ostracising me because of this. Need help desperately! Thanks. Hey all. I have a problem I need help with desperately, because I am at the end of my tether with this issue. (I am currently about to  about to submit a grad school thesis and working a new job at the same time, and this situation is causing me endless strain!)\\n\\n\\nSo we all know the Asian obsession with appearances etc. I have a fiancé who is wonderful in every way: He has a  financially stable job (in a STEM area) , besides being from a good university also. Moreover he also gives me plenty of emotional support and is always able to calm me in stressful situations. Not only that, he also helps around the house. He's a great guy in every way.\\n\\n\\nThe only lingering issue that has now become a massive life-straining problem (thanks to my mother) is that he is a bit overweight. He knows it and has been trying hard to lose weight, exercising and eating sensibly with my endless support. When we got engaged (about 1.5 years or so ago), my parents made him promise to lose so-and-so much weight by the wedding and he agreed. Throughout the year he did diet seriously and did a large amount of exercise, and he did lose a fair amount of weight. Unfortunately he didn't quite manage to lose as much as my parents expected and it is now two months before the wedding. Although he is continuing to lose more weight, my mum's relationship and regard for me has taken a dramatic downturn.\\n\\n\\nLast week, she screamed at me, yelling at me for dishonouring her because apparently I did not push him hard enough to 'keep his promise to them' and lose the large amount of weight they expected. And then she accused me of 'ruining the perfect wedding' and followed it up by saying what did she do to deserve a horrible daughter like me. She then said I was wasting my time marrying a man who clearly does not love me, since whatever 'love' he had for me was not enough of an incentive to help him lose the 'required' amount of weight. When I told my mother I am supporting and encouraging his weight loss, but I still loved him and want to marry him, she gave me the silent treatment throughout the week. \\n\\nShe only broke her silence this morning to anger me further, insisting even further that this guy does not love me and this wedding shouldn't go on etc. When I refused once again, she insisted - no doubt to spite me - she was going to invite a family acquaintance to the wedding who on many occasions has verbally abused me  and spread filthy lies around our Chinese friends about things that I didn't do, and that there was nothing I could do about it. (She said she would enforce this by bringing this family acquaintance to the wedding as her guest so that I cannot bar this person from coming.)\\n\\nI have endured two days in a row of her verbal and emotional torture. I know she is worried about his health, since of course being overweight can lead to diabetes, heart disease etc (and my dad later sensibly phoned me to console me and clarify that he  is just worried about my fiancé's health), but I'm not sure I can take anymore of her threatening, blaming and shaming. She accuses me endlessly of not controlling him and being harsh enough towards him, and said that he would have lost more weight had I nagged him, controlled him and threatened to leave him. \\n\\nTo help with his weight loss, I always make sure we eat healthily (he never eats any fast food/sweet stuff or drinks fizzy pop for the last couple of years except at a wedding where only fast food was served.), and I encourage as much exercise as possible e.g. organising hikes and bike trips almost every weekend. I also constantly remind him that I encourage his weight loss so that he remains healthy and will be at lower risk of health problems. However, I refuse to nag him ferociously, police his daily routine, fat-shame him, or give him ultimatums, because I've heard this negative approach only leads to further weight gain. But I am very confused right now:\\nDo you think my mum is being over the top about this issue, or am I really wrong by taking the encouraging approach instead of controlling him/nagging him/using ultimatums? I hate controlling and nagging people because it drains me psychologically and physically, and leaves me less time to develop myself. But is this approach selfish in this case?\\n\\nSorry for the long story but I am desperately in need of help, please. Thanks for your time.\\n\\n**UPDATE**: \\n Thanks so much all of you for taking the time to read my post and for responding in an hour of despair and need. Your replies have made me feel so much better and helped a great deal in restoring my emotional health after all the repercussions my mother jammed down my head. \\n\\nI knew all along that (1) encouraging and supporting was definitely the better approach as opposed to nagging or threatening and (2) my mum is making this more about herself than about us - going on and on about my fiance's bloody promise *to her* as opposed to his health, but I now feel better when I have others agreeing with me on my side. \\n\\nAs for the guest situation, my absolute superstar of a father has told my mother how twisted it was to even think of inviting someone like that to his daughter's wedding, and that if she tries in anyway at all to smuggle that person in he will personally make sure she (the guest) is thrown out no matter what it takes.\",\n",

But for some reason she was alive.\\n\\nShe was naked, the only part of her body not exposed to the air was her wrists that were covered by a pair of manacles. Shifting just slightly, she feels them strain against her. There’s the jingle of bronze as they are moved, then silence.\\n\\nShe opens her eyes. She’s seated in a familiar room; one carved out of gray stone, floor covered in a large mat and the walls overhung with tapestries. On the far end, a heatless enchanted fire cast an ominous light over a comfortable armchair.\\n\\nShe knew exactly where she was, and exactly who the withered crone in the armchair was.\\n\\n“*Mother.*” Lyssia felt her voice crack as if she hadn’t drank water in a couple of days. But considering that she was knocked out in Freidrich’s house, and the temple was a respectable distance away, that wasn’t unlikely.\\n\\nThe crone gave her a cold, mirthless smile. “Welcome home, daughter. Though since you betrayed our temple, I do believe you are no longer worthy of the title. Your former sisters were devastated over your betrayal. Especially the one you left with a shattered knee in the middle of the savage lands.”\\n\\n“So. Why am I here, naked but alive?”\\n\\nThe crone chuckled. “You are naked because we trained you. We are more than aware how skilled you are in squirreling away lockpicks, weapons, poisoned needles… removing the clothes was simply more effective. And as to why you’re alive, it isn’t by my choice. It’s because of what you have in your womb.”\\n\\n“So you-”\\n\\n“Know? Of course, dear. I’ve had the scryers on you since your betrayal was a fact. So I know about your pregnancy. And I wouldn’t send any of my daughters to kill a pregnant woman, no matter how filthy a traitor they are. Nor would I be willing to subject myself to Freya’s curse.”\\n\\n“So why are we talking, instead of me being in a cold cell?”\\n\\n\\n“Oh, dearie. We’ll get to that part soon, don’t be so eager!” all of the fraudulent pleasantry drains from the crone’s face. “We’re talking because I want to look you in the eyes as I tell you this: Until you give birth you’ll be rotting away in a small, barren cell. Then I am going to rip your baby from your arms. Slit your throat, and sell the child to the highest bidder.”\\n\\nLyssia strained against her bonds, her jaws clenched as she spat out her response. “I’ll kill you before that happens. **I’ll KILL YOU.**”\\n\\n“Good luck with that, dearie.” The smile returned to the crone’s lips, this time, far less false. “Daughters, take the traitor to her room.”\\n\\n---------------\\n\\nScratches. Unnatural grooves. It wasn’t much to go on, but beggars can’t be choosers. Freidrich stood up. “This one. I think.”\\n\\nHe pointed down the left cave passage. It looked to be an underground road, of sorts. There were holders for torches on an even interval, but the holders were empty and the road looked long-abandoned. There were scratches there as if something had been dragged along. Hopefully, that something was Lyssia.\\n\\n“You sure, lieutenant?”\\n\\n“As sure as I can be. No dirt down here. No greenery either. Can’t tell how old the tracks are.”\\n\\n“...Alright..” Garen sighed, and scratched a big, noticable X on the left side of the tunnel they came from. There had already been several splits in the road, and Freidrich was praying they were going in the right direction.\\n\\n“Emmet, the torch.”\\n\\nThe youngest member in the platoon handed the torch over to Freidrich.\\n\\nFreidrich took point, his longsword drawn and resting on his shoulder, and the torch raised above his head.\\n\\nThe old road was a magnificent construction. A marvel of stonework, seemingly carved from the natural caverns that wormed through the stone. But who built it? And why was it abandoned?\\n\\nThose were questions for another time, he concluded as they pressed onwards.\\n\\nIt was impossible to tell how long they had been walking down this endless, uniform road, but it felt like hours as they marched onwards. Still, no further signs of recent passage, nor did the conditions change.\\n\\nThe road was filled with oppressive darkness, something their lone active torch did little to banish.\\n\\n“Sir!”\\n\\nFreidrich stopped, and Garen who had been walking second barely avoids crashing into his back. “What is it, Barend?”\\n\\n“Dieter is gone, sir!“ The man sounded slightly panicked.\\n\\n“What do you mean gone?”\\n\\n“He was just behind me, but he’s gone!”\\n\\n“Dammit, Emmet. Light a second torch. Two groups. Ammet, Garen, you’re with me. Emmet, you’re with Barend. Keep your partners close. We have no idea what’s out there. We’re going back for him.”\\n\\nTurning around the squad and walking back the way they came, it didn’t take long for them to find where Dieter’s shield was laid resting towards the side of the underground road, as well as wet stains on the wall and floor, but no further signs of the man.\\n\\n“Looks like he stopped for a piss. Dieter! Dieter, where are you, man?!”\\n\\nLooking around, it seemed as if Dieter had vanished into thin air, pack and equipment all.\\n\\n“Look around! He can’t have gone far without light.”\\n\\n“Sir…” Emmet’s voice was a quiet whisper.\\n\\n“What is-”\\n\\nTurning to look at Emmet, he saw the young man was pale as if he had seen a ghost, torch held far above his head, and his gaze directed straight upwards. Following the man’s gaze, he saw what had the man so spooked.\\n\\nIt didn’t seem that Dieter had gone far at all.\\n\\nNo. As he gazed up, he could just barely make out movement in the space above where the torchlight reached. The movement of something human-sized spinning.\\n\\nBut that wasn’t the worst of it. He saw countless beads of reflective blackness, as if there were opals gleaming in the ceiling, in groups of eight.\\n\\n“Emmet! Crossbow! **NOW**!”\\n\\nThere was a clank as the second torch fell to the ground, and the man pulled the crossbow from its’ resting place on his back.\\n\\nIt seemed the sound had not gone unnoticed, and a fiendish skittering that crawled upon Freidrich’s very soul was heard as a blur of motion exploded above them.\\n\\n“**TO ARMS!**”\\n\\nThe sound of metal being drawn surrounded him as the young man’s crossbow thwanged. There was a bestial screech as it struck true, straight in one of the cluster of eyes.\\n\\nFreidrich dropped the second torch to the ground, grasping the hilt of his long sword with both hands. A spider, far larger than any of those creatures had any right to be fell from the ceiling, bolt stinging out of its’ face. The damn thing was the size of a horse!\\n\\n“For Leto!” he found himself bellowing as a warcry, Charging another beast as it sank towards the ground suspended on infernal silken threads.\\n\\nThe sword swung true, and he heard a unholy squelch as ichor splashed over him. The thing screeched, a sound that made him sick to the bottom of his stomach, and all around him he heard his comrades engaging the beasts. Two more came where one had fallen. The roof was full of them.\\n\\nThey were everywhere.\\n\\n“Fight, men! There is no retreat! Slay them all!”\\n\\nHe swung. He felt it hit true, more ichor. He felt himself impacted by tremendous weight as another beast fell upon him, pinning him to the ground. There was the scratching of chitin on metal as the thing’s stinger slid across the back of his plate. Dragging himself around to face it, he feels it as it strikes him again and again, failing to find purchase.\\n\\nAt such close range, he can impossibly use his longsword, thus instead he draws the short dagger hilted at his belt. He stuck it up, and he heard the spider screech, but it would not die. He struck again and again, drawing a cascade of foul ichor with each strike.\\n\\nThe spider became more and more desperate with each strike, frenetically sticking at him again and again.\\n\\nFreidrich prayed it would fail.\\n\\nAgain and again he struck, and then the beast crumpled.\\n\\nOnto him.\\n\\nIt weighed as much as it looked to, and Freidrich struggled to be free of the weight.\\n\\nIt shifted! Slowly, he broke himself free, pushing the beast aside. Getting up, panting, he looked around. Emmet’s torch had gone out in a puddle of ichor, but he could see dimly in the light of his own torch, still struggling to grant them light from the ground.\\n\\nAround him were dozens of crumpled spider corpses, but he could no longer see Emmet or Garen. They were being overrun. Still the spiders came, and he was becoming tired.\\n\\nFreidrich picked up his blade. He would not die like this. He would avenge his beloved. He felt a fire at the pit of his stomach.\\n\\nHe would kill them all. Every spider in this accursed cave would feel his wrath.\\n\\nWith a wordless roar, he leapt back into the battle, cutting and cleaving like a man possessed.\\n\\nThese beasts didn’t pose a challenge to him, save from the mass of their bodies as they fell.\\n\\nDeath surrounded him. Dead spiders fell all around. Soon, he found his lost comrades. Emmet was stuck beneath a fallen spider, and Freidrich pushed it aside with a mighty kick.\\n\\nThe beast slid across the slick floor, freeing the young crossbowman.\\n\\nHe then found Garen in the process of being wrapped into a cocoon of spider silk. He cut the spider down, and with his return slash he cut Garen free from his bondage.\\n\\nHe cut, and he cut, and he cut.\\n\\nStanding, panting, leaning towards the side of the passage, he looked around at his handiwork as the last of the spiders fled for their lives.\\n\\nHe gave up counting the corpses at around twenty.\\n\\nHe could hear the clanking of metal onto stone as his hand dropped the longsword. He couldn’t feel his fingers. Hell. He couldn’t feel the entirety of his arm.\\n\\nAll he felt was an infernal burn consuming each of his muscles.\\n\\n“Sir? Are you alright?” Emmet had approached him without him even noticing.\\n\\n“Nevermind me, get Dietrich down from there.” Freidrich commanded, just as his legs began to fail.\\n\\nFreidrich collapsed to the ground, and his world started to fade to black.\\n\\n*Well, at least that explains why no one seemed to be maintaining this road*\\n\\n------\\n\\nThis was probably the worst cell Lyssia had ever been in. It was little more than a stone box. The floor, ceiling and walls completely bare. It was a two-meter by two-meter piece of her personal hell.\\n\\nShe had examined every inch of the thing and it was nothing but smooth stone all around, with the exception of the solid metal door.\\n\\nThe lock on the door was exceptional. Anything less would probably have been meant as an insult, but not that it mattered.\\n\\nThey had taken her clothes, and with them her tools of the trade.\\n\\nIf only she still had her lockpicks from the secret pocket on her sleeve…\\n\\nThe food-slit at the bottom of the door slid open, and a wooden bowl was slid in, followed by a cup of similar crude make.\\n\\n“Dinner.” The brisk voice of the jailer was… familiar.\\n\\n“Drada?” Lyssia mused.\\n\\nThe slit was closed with a thud and a grunt from her captor. So, she had guessed right.\\n\\nOf course the Mother of the temple would place *her* as Lyssia’s jailer.\\n\\nDrada was a mean brute of a drow, and Lyssia had always despised her.\\n\\nShe heard the latch on the slit slide shut.\\n\\nShe inspected the food.\\n\\nStew and water. Marvellous.\\n\\nWell, she felt completely parched, so she didn’t complain as she took the food handed to her.\\n\\nMaybe she could break loose some splinters of the bowl to fashion a crude lockpick?\\n\\nLyssia’s lips curled up, just ever so slightly.\\n\\nShe wouldn’t give up. She would get out of here, and she’d wring the old hag’s neck.\\n\\nShe swore on the gods and on her life.\\n\\nShe would not give up.\\n\\nAfter finishing her meal, she set about preparing to make her escape.\\n\\nShe scooted up to the door, and listened intently.\\n\\nNot a sound.\\n\\nShe moved over to the other side of the cell, and smashed the side of the empty bowl into the solid stone. Then she waited and listened to see if someone noticed what she was doing. Not a sound.\\n\\nThen again.\\n\\nThen again.\\n\\nFinally, the bowl started to break, with splinters forming.\\n\\nLyssia quietly dug her nails into the splintering wood, and pulled free a decently-sized fragment of wood.\\n\\nShe took the splinter in hand. It wasn’t too thick, so it would be fragile.\\n\\nShe scooted back to the door, listening for movement outside.\\n\\nNothing yet. She didn’t know where Drada was. It would be too risky to make her move yet.\\n\\nShe had to wait.\\n\\nPushing the bowl and cup towards the slit, Lyssia crawled up into a corner, her wooden splinter in hand, attempting to keep warm.\\n\\nIt wasn’t too cold down here in the great below, but it was still uncomfortable without clothes.\\n\\nShe had to figure out the guard rotations, the schedule. She would wait. She would watch.\\n\\nShe still had a little time.\\n\\nShe rubbed her stomach gently.\\n\\n*But not too much.*',\n",

       " 'Re: Pictures of fish on the ground (Time to revisit this) Folks, \\n\\n\\n\\nTime and time again I check this forum to see beautiful fish flopped down on the ground for the sake of a picture. There\\'s info on the sidebar for [catch and release](http://redd.it/umjfz) but I\\'m not sure if anyone ever reads it. \\n\\nSo, I figured it would be nice for a refresher to hang around on the front page for a few days, and help some of the newer anglers that may not be aware of the appropriate ways to take a picture of a fish while minimizing the potential for injury. \\n\\n* If you use a net, avoid knotted nylon nets. These cause injury and abrasions to fish while removing their protective membrane layer. Try to acquire catch and release friendly nets. It\\'s OK to keep the fish in the next (in the water) and still get a great picture. It minimizes impact on the fish, and also keeps them breathing well during the time they\\'re \"caught\"\\n\\n\\n* Never put fish, especially trout, on dry ground (for the same reason as the knotted nets) As an addendum, I don\\'t really like putting them on wet ground either. You\\'re taking an unnecessary risk by doing this. \\n\\n\\n* Never put your fingers in a fish\\'s gill plates. Many anglers are drawn to this as a handle, but it will seal that fish\\'s fate after you touch the inside of the gill plate.\\n\\n\\n\\n* Finally, if you have to pick up the fish, **always** **always** wet your hands before handling them. Do not squeeze them. Slip your hand gently under them while they\\'re in the net until they relax. Be as swift as possible while getting your photo. \\n\\nAs a general rule of thumb, if at any point the fish starts to struggle or what-have-you while you\\'re taking a picture, give it up and let him back in the water. There\\'s no sense in killing a fish because you wanted to make sure you got the perfect shot. \\n\\n\\nIf anyone wants to add to or critique any of these, it is most welcome and appreciated. \\n\\n**EDIT:** Obviously, pictures on the ground are kind of a moot point if you\\'re going to keep and eat the fish.',\n",

I've heard things from the bus platform at Jane Station doesn't have enough space but that is untrue. Keele station has much less space and artics still run there so it's not that. The only legitimate reason i can think of is there isn't enough buses to spare but then if that is the case, why not transfer artics to Jane from a route of lesser priority. What is the reluctance to run Artics on Jane? It seriously needs them badly. Even with the proposed split of Jane buses at Eglinton probably doesn't mean much. The northern section would probably still be extremely busy. The busiest section is Eglinton - Finch and i live smack dab in the middle of that. If large crowds of people can gather at Trethewey, one of the lesser used stops out of all the major intersections, we have an issue.

       " 'A discussion of firearms in FPS games. This is going to be a discussion that covers a few inter-related thoughts I\\'ve had about firearms representations in FPS games. I\\'m going be sticking mostly with \"realistic\" themed games (*Call of Duty, Battlefield Far-Cry, STALKER*, etc...) although some of the themes of the discussion can be translated to less \"realistic\" games, primarily open world type games like *Fallout 3/NV*.\\n\\n***\\n\\nFirstly: Firearms in any game which have \"realistic\" setting should be as visually accurate as possible, and should be accurate to the setting if the game is set in a particular historical era.\\n\\nSome games, like the *Call of Duty* series, are fast paced action games and thus will not have realistic trappings like magazine counts or selectable fire rates. This is fine, given that the game is not interested in being a simulator - not every game needs to be *ArmA*.\\n\\nHowever realistic weapon aesthetics do a lot to help a game- first off it makes the game standout from the generic horde of FPS games on the market and gives it enough flavor to give the impression that it is a different experience. And for anyone who is familiar with real life firearms or history (if the game is historical) it helps with immersion rather than distracts from it.\\n\\nMy biggest example of an offender is *Call of Duty: Black Ops*, which I borrowed from a friend and played through (as I have with every *COD* since *MW2*). I was actually excited about this game, because while I figured it would be the standard *COD* flare, I was excited about using all 60s\\' era weapons. I was sorely disappointed to find that more than 50% of the weapons roster was comprised of weapons which didn\\'t exist, and that weapons were still using the very modern modular rail system for attachments.\\n\\nThis had very little affect on the gameplay directly- Replacing the FAMAS rifles that the Soviet soldiers carried with historically accurate AKMS rifles could have been done while keeping the same damage and rate of fire stats. But, giving the characters historically accurate weapons would have greatly increased immersion as well as differentiating it from other *COD* games.\\n\\nThere are some places where slight tweaks to gameplay would have to be accommodated for more historical accuracy, but it would also serve to strengthen rather than weaken the game. Primarily I am thinking of the fact that the M16A1 rifles in the games should have had 20 rounds magazines, and that iron sights should have been far more common for all the weapons.\\n\\nSome of this seems extremely simple to me- the M79 model already existed for *MW2*, why not port it over to *Black ops* for example.\\n\\nOne final note before moving away from talking about *Black Ops*: It isn\\'t just weapons- but uniforms, slang, equipment, and visual style (of the campaign, I realize concessions will be made for multiplayer). It should be and can be made historically accurate without degrading the gameplay dynamic intended by the developer.  \\n\\n***\\n\\nSecond: The weapon should be an avatar for your character. \\n\\nThink about it, what is the one constant of an FPS game? The fact that you will have a weapon taking up the bottom quarter of your screen, right?\\n\\nSo games should be designed to make the weapon an extension of the player. (This is a thought that would change, somewhat the dynamic of most modern fast paced FPS games.)\\n\\nWhat happens in most modern *COD* or *Battlefield* campaigns? You clear a room of enemies and then search the corpses for that one particular weapon that you have found fits your style. \\n\\nThis easter-egg hunting for weapons slows down the pace of the game abruptly and it doesn\\'t even fight in with the old FPS design philosophy of finding better weapons as you progress, because players in modern games see most of the weapons in the first couple of levels.\\n\\nSo instead of starting levels with a preassigned weapon that the player has no attachment to, games should have a weapon creation screen (akin to most ranked multiplayer options), where the weapon can progress with them throughout the game. \\n\\nThis does a lot of things: First it lets players starts levels with weapons they already want, which cuts down on time spent searching for a weapon, and keeps them engaged with the gameplay story.\\n\\nSecondly, it allows the levels to be better crafted because the developers can restrict certain options until certain points in the game. So for example, if there is a portion that would be absurdly easy if the player used an underslung grenade launcher, the developer can restrict the grenade launcher from appearing until after the level is complete.\\n\\nThirdly, developers can not finding secret items or completing trophy achievements actually mean something in-game by giving the player weapon-related rewards (even something as simple as an extra camouflage would make people more excited about coming across an in-game collectable.)\\n\\nForth, it would allow replayability to be increased. If a player earns a suppressor after beating the game and then plays the campaign in a \"Game +\" mode, they might have more options in how to beat an early level while using their late-game equipment.\\n\\nOn a different tangent of the weapon as a player avatar- that thought can be used more literally. \\n\\nIf the player is injured badly in a scripted sequence, they can be shown the extent of their injuries by having their once pristine weapon become extremely scratched up or even have the player character leave blood on it as the touch it. Perhaps a late game sequence could have any attachments on top of the weapon become broken, forcing the player \"back-to-the-basics\" of using iron sights.\\n\\nAlso, it makes switching character perspectives much more jarring and effective for the narrative. \\n\\nIf the player spends a large number of levels playing as a Navy SEAL with a customized M4 with various add-ons and a 10\" free float barrel, then when they are put into the point of view of a middle eastern conscript with a bare bones AKM or Mosin, then it makes the player much more aware of the shift at a \"gut\" level.\\n\\n\\n',\n",

I\\'m a dick - if that area\\'s free, I DO park there.  I don\\'t feel parents need designated parking spots.  It doesn\\'t make any sense.\\n\\nIn the same grocery store, they have two sets of carts for children: \\n\\n1.  The smaller versions of the regular carts, where the children can push them around and be \"just like mommy and daddy\".  These little carts have a flag on them that says \"Customer in Training\".  How about you put your kid in the cart so he/she\\'s out of the way?!  It\\'s a Price Chopper for crying out loud - it\\'s ALWAYS busy and the last thing I want to do is run into your child or be forced to maneuver around him/her.\\n\\n2.  The other type of cart is the gigantic plastic ones that have a race car or what-have-you growing out from the front of a regular cart like a big, red, zit.  That cart is about 6 feet long...and it\\'s SERIOUSLY hard to move around that shit when it\\'s barreling down the aisles, with a parent who thinks everyone else should be dodging out of their way.\\n\\nWhen I was a kid, I sat in the regular cart and had a book or a toy or something to behave.  We didn\\'t have all that newfangled annoying bullshit that gets in the way of everyone else.  And there certainly weren\\'t any spots designated for anything other than the handicapped.\\n\\nThoughts?\\n\\n',\n",

       " 'Are You Open To New Ideas? I recently posted a blurb and link about how I changed my life (the mini habits one). Because I\\'m passionate about the topic, some thought it looked like an ad. I urged people to read the article, I claimed big things, etc. Salesy stuff I guess.\\n\\nToday, we are inundated with constant marketing and suffer from information overload. I think that makes it really easy for us to dismiss ideas if the \"packaging\" isn\\'t perfect. I want to warn you about doing that. Consider that the type of person who comes up with an effective strategy for life change might not be the best person at marketing that message in a way that doesn\\'t make you dismiss it as being \"too salesy.\"\\n\\nI\\'m sincere and honest, but that\\'s not easy to convey online. And when I tell people I\\'ve put on 10-15 pounds of muscle by starting with one push-up a day, maybe that\\'s hard to believe, but it\\'s true. And how could I not get excited about that? How could I not want to implore people to read about this strategy?\\n\\nAnd by the way, the message I\\'m speaking of and the article it links to are both FREE to read. \\n\\nWhen you claim a strategy can change someone\\'s life, people will be skeptical (as they should be). **But don\\'t look at *how* the person is saying it—look at the *logic* of what they\\'re saying, read the comments if it\\'s an article, read the reviews if it\\'s a book, etc.** \\n\\nIf you base decisions on what emotion you feel by reading something, you won\\'t make the right decisions. You know who are experts at manipulating your emotions and making something seem great? ACTUAL salesmen and marketers. I\\'m not either of those, and so I probably make novice errors when I tell people about mini habits.\\n\\nI\\'m as passionate about this mini habits idea as I am against the ones that are popular. The Getmotivated subreddit has over 1 million subscribers, which is over 10x as many as the Getdisciplined subreddit. What does that tell you? People are addicted to the short term rush of motivation, and because they rely on it, they will never achieve lasting change.\\n\\nYou can look for validation of your current beliefs and resist anything that contradicts it, or you can be open to hear new ideas. Only the latter mindset will allow you to grow as a person, because \"if you want something you have never had, you must be willing to do something you have never done.\"\\n\\nFor me, that something I had never done before was aim for a small goal I couldn\\'t fail to reach. Then I did it every day. And now I have achieved a lot of things I never had before. For those of you who attempt to change in the same ways that have never worked, you should know that *the problem isn\\'t you.* It\\'s not that you\\'re not trying hard enough. It\\'s not that you need more motivation. It\\'s your strategy that needs fixing. Try a new approach.',\n",

If I'm a student out of uWaterloo, and I'm approached by a recruiter at Google offering me 150k in the Bay area compared to the sub-100k salary I'd pull in Toronto for a comparable cost of living, the choice is obvious.\\n\\nNow, if I'm that same student and I'm being offered even say 50% of what I'd make in the US, the choice is obvious in the opposite direction - 75k in Windsor is more than decent, you'd be close to family and friends, and you wouldn't have to go through the gauntlet that is obtaining a work visa in the US as a tech worker. \\n\\nOne thing I do see often in the Toronto area (through job postings) are tech startups receiving funding. Unfortunately, these startups typically stay in the Toronto area - why? There's no real reason to stay in Toronto as a tech company when considerably cheaper office space is just three hours south, in a location where you can afford to pay a lower salary for a candidate that still offsets the cost of living of the area by a comfortable margin. You'd also gain access to students from the University of Windsor who may otherwise have been apprehensive about moving to the GTA due to the cost of living, with the additional benefit of attracting young minds from Toronto who seek cheaper housing/apartments.\\n\\nAll in all, I'd love the tech sector in Canada as a whole to blossom - and maybe this is better suited to r/Canada, but in terms of our city what do you guys think? Are we not marketing ourselves properly to attract the right entrepreneurial types that could kick up the tech industry here? Are we simply not retaining talent nationwide? Do we not have the framework on a local (or national level) to re-brand ourselves as Detroit is managing to do?\",\n",
       " 'My thoughts on Galaxy’s Edge after spending 2 days there Hello there, I just came back from a trip to Disneyland (it’s treason then) mainly for Galaxy’s Edge, here are my detailed thoughts. I apologize for the length, but I think I occasionally raise interesting points. I hope at least someone reads this lol.  \\n  \\nWalking into the land was exciting. You walk through a regular forested trail, but slowly the animal sounds begin to sound more foreign, the lamps suddenly look like they belong on Tatooine, and occasionally there’s a few Gonk Droid tracks in the ground. A subtle, sparkly music plays, composed by Williams and Giacchino. It sounds quite different than the regular Star Wars score, but it has whispers of the recognizable themes. This only plays as you enter the land, there’s no ambient music on Batuu, unlike everywhere else in Disneyland, which was great. You stumble upon a few moisture-vaporators, and then come face-to-face with an A-Wing and an X-Wing parked along the trail. Seeing that was cool, but only the beginning.  \\n  \\nThe ambience and aesthetics were off the charts. Old blaster shots in the walls, the sound of ships taking off or landing or flying overhead causing you to duck, moisture vaporators making vaporator sounds, various star-wars-esque beeps from electronics like control panels, sliding blast doors for most buildings, stormtroopers on patrol. It all just felt so real, so lived-in, like Blackspire Outpost has been there for decades or even centuries and that you were truly on another world. Almost all of the signs in-land were in Aurebesh which was awesome and fun to show off to your lame friends who don’t know how to read a useless fictional language. Even basic stuff on trash cans like “Trash to sector 3287”. And the rules posted outside of the cantina were entirely in aurebesh which was kinda funny. The theming really immersed you in Star Wars.  \\n  \\nEventually, you turn a corner and THERE’S THE MILLENNIUM FALCON. Just sitting there, full size, refuelling, steam shooting out sometimes. It was incredible, and huge. You never realize how large it really is in-person by watching the movies. Look at the size of that thing!  \\n  \\nThe main store section is the marketplace, which seems as though it was lifted right from the movies, and reminded me a bit of a middle-eastern bazaar, with the lamps and tapestries overhead. I almost expected Uncle Owen to stroll through, looking for droid parts or power converters. The stuff you could buy was a bit limited (I find your lack of stock disturbing) as they apparently keep everything in-land “canon” (which is RIDICULOUS, but more on that later). Each stall sold different things. At Toydarian Toymaker you could buy these stitched plush dolls of several characters, the ones I remember are Yoda, Rey, Kylo, Finn, Stormtrooper (Empirical! and FO), Jabba, Chewie, Leia, Lando (Gambino version :/), Porg, and Watto! which was a huge surprise. They were all about $22, which isn’t horrible. But except for Watto, NO prequel characters. Actually, pretty much nothing in the land referenced the prequels at all which was really lame and disappointing, save for a scrapped battle droid hanging from a wall somewhere, and some trinkets you could buy like the Naboo headcrest. Also unless memory is incorrect, no stuffies of VADER??, or Emperor, Luke, Obi-Wan, Han, Anakin, Padme, Jar Jar, Ewoks, etc. I get that they can’t make all of the characters into plushies (well I mean, they COULD), but still, having Gambino Lando rather than a single Vader or Luke doll was strange. I guess it’s probably because “Looke Sky-Wokka? I thot he wuz a MIFF...”  \\n  \\nThere were wooden stormtrooper dolls like the one Jyn had in R1 which was pretty neat (for $40...). And various trinkets like a music box that played the Imperial march, Han’s dice, etc.\\nA ton of their stuff was sold out though. No Sabacc cards, no Japor Snippets, no Chance cubes, no Dejarik table, no Kyber Crystals, no Luke’s saber, no Ahsoka’s, no Obi-Wan’s. The ones they had in stock were Anakin’s (the seller referred to it as “That one is Rey’s, and before that it was Master Luke’s!” soooo I guess Anakin didn’t exist. It makes more sense to call it the Youngling-Slayer than Rey’s saber), Vader’s, Asajj Ventress’s, Maul’s (which was only one-sided but you could buy two and attach them. lol. I bet the attacher costs another $25), Mace’s, and Kylo’s. They were $140 each, but with a blade they were $180. Pretty steep, especially for not including the blade.  \\n  \\nIn the same store (Dok-Ondor’s Den of Antiquities) Dok-Ondor was a very realistic Ithorian animatronic, behind some glass doing bookkeeping and stuff which was really cool. They sold a bunch of higher-end stuff there. Busts of various Jedi or Sith, the Naboo headcrest for $40, Leia buns wig, Leia’s white dress, Jyn’s Kyber Crystal necklace ($99 for a rock and a strip of leather), Sith Chalice, Sith and Jedi Holocrons, stuff like that which was really cool, and of course a ton of TLJ shit like the rebellion logo ring for $125, Rose’s special asian necklace for $75 per half, so if you want your sister to hold one while she dies for nothing then you’ve gotta pay double. I’m surprised broom boy’s broom wasn’t on sale for $100.  \\nThey sold extra Kyber Crystals there as well for use in the saber you can create (more on that later). They were supposed to have Green Blue Red Orange Yellow White Purple, but all they had for sale was Blue and Red (but you can choose between blue green purple or red when building your own lightsaber, always in stock for that). And you couldn’t just buy the crystals themselves, you had to purchase a $50 holocron first, and then the crystal was $20 on top of that. For a plastic rock you’ll never even see anyway. But apparently when all colours are stocked you can buy them without a holocron.  \\n\\nThere was a factory you could build your own droid for $100, it was really cool inside though I didn’t do it as I probably wouldn’t use it much as it’s pretty much just an expensive remote-controlled toy that beeps. Plus I read stuff about people’s breaking all the time.  \\n  \\nThe lightsaber building was a very cool experience, despite my few gripes with it. It’s a hidden “scrap shop” so the FO doesn’t find out that they just... sell lightsabers to anybody lol. Sounds really stupid on paper, but afterall, it’s a theme park and that reasoning definitely worked if you were there. It’s just dumb they want everything there to be canon. If it wasn’t then I wouldn’t have a problem. In person that reasoning felt fine, cool actually, but reading about it it’s really dumb.  \\n  \\nSo beforehand, you pay the $215 and select from 4 themes that dictate which pieces you can use for your build. I chose Peace and Justice as that’s the closest to the traditional-looking Jedi saber we all know and love, parts that would look natural on Obi-Wan’s or Luke’s. My least favourite of the bunch was the Elemental Nature theme, it looked not like Star Wars. Really goofy and like plastic in some bits, the way it looked was like it was lifted from someone’s Tumblr OriginalCharacter drawing to supplement their shitty fanfic, except expensive. Similar to TLJ in that way... And the Rancor tooth you could have on the end was a bit strange and didn’t feel or look like Star Wars at all.  \\nThe other two were Protection and Defense which had gold bits and was a bit like Mace’s saber, more Old Republic-looking, and then Power and Control which was the “evil-looking” sabers ala Vader (not really evil-looking but you know what I mean, sith sabers). So 3/4 themes felt like Star Wars, which I guess isn’t too bad.\\nBefore my group entered, two FO troopers came over and said a few things. It was pretty funny, and cool to actually talk to a stormtrooper. Then the “gatherers” (people who collect all the lightsaber scrap pieces from ruins of ancient Jedi sites) rushed us inside before the stormtroopers came back.  \\nIt was a full amazing experience, and I was totally able to lose myself in it and feel as if I was really constructing my own elegant weapon to pave my own path in the galaxy, rather than giving Disney my life’s savings. Before construction, you close your eyes and let the force guide you to your crystal colour. The fact that they offered a red one is a bit weird if this is all canon, but again, the weird canon stuff in the land didn’t really bother me as it is just a theme park. I picked green because the best Jedi had green sabers, don’t @me (except Obi). When everyone turned their sabers on for the first time it was truly magical. It felt like I was part of the Jedi Order, about to go fight some separatists. At the end before you leave, Yoda’s voice shows up (by Frank Oz so it sounds great). I forget what he said but I think just something like mmmm force is strong with them yes. But it felt cool. They give you a long canvas shoulder-sling bag to carry it around in, and a pin depending on which theme you chose. A belt clip was not included and sold separate for $20. I caved and bought one because I spent a fortune on my lightsaber and wanted to show it off.  \\nThe saber itself is pretty good quality. It’s fully metal save for the internal components, so very sturdy and has a good weight to it, and it’s really neat how the crystal is actually in the centre of it all. The blade is fine, detachable obviously, but pretty much just a white tube of LED’s but it looks good, especially in photographs as the bright light gets washed out so it doesn’t just look like a straight tube and more like a real plasma blade. The sound is delayed a bit on the initial first swings, but after you’re in motion there isn’t as much of a delay. Could definitely bother some people though.  \\n  \\nI also bought a Kowakian Monkey-Lizard puppet, which is awesome. Named it Atribilious, just not sure on the last name so suggestions are appreciated. It’s a life-like (albeit smaller) puppet that can swivel it’s head and move it’s mouth, as well as make sounds if a switch is flipped, and sits perched on your shoulder with a magnet. It’s very very cool, especially if you’re just sitting casually or walking somewhere not paying attention and he looks around seemingly on his own, it really appears quite real. What convinced me to get one was seeing a kid sitting in the cantina on his phone casually, with his MonkeyLizard just sitting on his shoulder and looking around, occasionally cackling. It was so convincing that it was real! I enjoyed making people laugh as my MonkeyLizard turned his head as if looking at the people we walked by.  \\nWhen I bought him and was walking around, a Stormtrooper came up to me and said “You there, stop! ...Looks like he’ll make a great pet.” then he stuck his finger out to pet him, and I opened the puppet’s mouth as if it bit his hand, which he pulled away and said “Well, good luck. Now move along.” and motioned for me to, well, move along. It was awesome.  \\n  \\nStormtroopers, Kylo, Rey, and Chewie were the only recognizable characters that occasionally roamed the land. My question is, why no C-3PO, General Leia, Poe, Phasma, Bigtitty Milk Alien, Finn, and uhh Rose, etc. (Of course my and most people’s top choice would be if it was OT themed, or not nailed to a specific era). There was also that blue-haired chick the whole story of the theme park is based around, except you wouldn’t ever know that unless you read whatever book she’s from, which is good. I only saw her once, and she wasn’t stopped, just walking quickly.  \\nThe character meetings work a lot different than the rest of Disney, there aren’t lineups for photos or anything, it’s pretty much just a casual walk up and chat with them (save for Kylo). It felt natural and real. A tourist was taking a selfie with a stormtrooper, and the stormtrooper pulled away when he noticed and said “Hey, put that datapad away!”  \\nChewie held a competition to see which hairy bearded man had the best wookiee call, it was really funny. Though Chewie’s costume is kind of horrid. His lips were white and his fur was a bit gray on the back. But he still sounded and acted just like him, though far too short. One of the tall men in the competition was the same height as him if not a bit taller, which is really dumb. Chewie is 7’6”+, not under 7’...\\nAnother fun thing he did was I walked by him one time and he did a wookiee call and pointed at me. I turned to him and then he pointed at his hip and then at me, indicating my saber on my belt. I grabbed it and let out a wookiee call, and he raised his arms and did it back. It just felt so cool!  \\nI didn’t interact with Rey because I don’t acknowledge her existence, but the actress vaguely resembled Ridley. Her and Chewie would sometimes just have their own conversations, like you could see them talking to each other alone from far away (chewie ofc wasn’t talking). They looked like they were having a real conversation like they would if they were hanging out in the Falcon. It’s all just so immersive and real-feeling.  \\n  \\nThe Disney “castmembers” (employees) all acted in-universe, which was so cool (most of the time). Dollars were credits, so something that’s $2.50 would be referred to as 2.5 or 2 and a half Credits.  \\nThey greeted you with “Bright suns!” or “Rising moons” depending on the time of day, which helped the immersion even if those terms don’t feel like Star Wars at all. There were also other terms such as “Til the spire” which I have no idea what it means and doesn’t feel like SW either. Actually I have no idea what the “Blackspire” in Blackspire Outpost is even referencing.  \\n  \\nWhile waiting in line for a restaurant I started talking to a castmember about where he was from. “Oh, Batuu, my family’s always been from Batuu.” he explained he only comes to Blackspire Outpost (the town we’re in) for work, his family lives near the Batuuan Sea and most of them are fisherman. It seemed like he was REALLY from Batuu. I had my whole backstory ready, but he had to help someone else unfortunately. However NOT all of the employees are that dedicated, if at all. When I bought my MonkeyLizard I asked the cashier  \\n“So uh, anything I should know beforehand? What do I feed him?”  \\n“Uhh... I’m not sure... haha... that’ll be $75.”  \\nPretty lame. Not everyone would use the credits terminology for money.  \\n  \\nThe Millennium Falcon ride really made my lifelong dream come true. The circle is now complete. The line was long but very worth it (that’s also where I met a girl that I swear to god is going to be The One That Got Away). The narrative of the ride is that you enter Hondo Onaka’s (that autocorrected to Obama) Transport Solutions in order to get some work. He signs you up for a heist of sorts, and Chewie agrees to lend the Falcon as long as he and the Resistance get some percent of the profits (I hope this means that Chewie is the true owner going forward, and not Rey or Ben Solo. Yeesh). In the line there’s an amazingly lifelike animatronic of Hondo which was cool. He hires you to travel to Corellia to steal Coaxium to make him lots of money, natural for Onaka. I was initially bummed that it was Coaxium and that we were going to Corellia (and it appeared as if it easily could’ve been Coruscant), but in the ride I forgot all about my gripes. You eventually find yourself on a boarding ramp like a Star Wars version of how you get onto a plane from the gate at an airport, and at the end you walk through the Falcon hallway and end up in the main room where the Dejarik table was. Initially stepping through the hallways of the Falcon made me cry, it was indescribable. I was really THERE. In the main room there was a short wait where you could look around and take photos and stuff, and after that you are brought to the cockpit. Oh boy oh boy. I was lucky enough to get co-pilot on my first go. Sitting in Chewie’s chair was like I was in a dream. (Also them not being allowed to say Younglings is a myth, the safety recording for the Falcon says “be sure to watch over your younglings.” Youngling ban? I thot it wuz a MIFF).  \\nThe ride was amazing, it truly felt like I was piloting the falcon. The screens looked incredibly life-like to me. The 3 people I came with all felt it was real as well. It was incredible to control the ship and take off from Batuu and soar into space... and then it was time to enter hyperspace. My pilot told me to punch it, I pulled the lever, and there we went. Lightspeed. One of the best feelings I’ve ever felt. I wish the hyperspace lasted a little longer as it was only a few seconds before we arrived above the atmosphere of Corellia. I won’t go into too much detail about our mission, but chasing after the train, yelling commands at my crew, veering side to side to avoid TIEs shooting at us. It was just... awesome. I was in awe.  \\n  \\nI do wish the ride was longer, it felt quite short, especially for the long wait. After we landed back in Batuu, Hondo assessed the damages to the ship. He subtracts the damages from the amount of credits you earn. Then the door to the cockpit opens and a castmember comes in to make sure you leave (because otherwise I wouldn’t). We exited into the hallway of the Falcon which appeared to be quite damaged, sparks popping, wires dangling, box of thermal detonators spilled onto the floor. I had a very fun interaction with the CastMember:  \\nCM: “Everybody off, c’mon! Wow, who was flying this thing? Keep an eye on them, might need to go back to their system’s flight academy...”  \\nMe: “What do you mean?”  \\n“Look at the ship! It’s a mess!”  \\n“Well everyone’s alive, aren’t they?”  \\n“That’s not what counts! Th-“  \\n“Yeah, what counts is the 9000 credits we made!”  \\n“...Nine, *THOUSAND* credits? Well... just, get out of here!”  \\n“Good thinking!”  \\nAnd then I stormed off, dopey grin on my face. I felt like a true part of the universe. I felt like Han Solo. I piloted the MILLENNIUM FALCON and pulled the lever to activate the HYPERDRIVE! And SMUGGLED. It felt incredible.  \\nThe other role I tried was Engineer, which was a bit boring as all you do is press buttons when they light up. I understand why it’s there though, it’s a theme park and has to be accessible for a lot of people. Was still great just sitting in the cockpit as someone else flew it around, I felt like Luke! But I can definitely see how people would be annoyed if they waited for an hour and didn’t get to fly it. Luckily people were mostly willing to trade which was nice.  \\n  \\nOga’s Cantina was pretty cool. It was small and intimate so it felt like a real Cantina. The bar looked like, well, it’s hard to describe, but the bar itself looked and felt like Star Wars. A few creatures in tanks, a small frogdog laying eggs, bubbling colourful liquids connected to taps. The drinks were fun too, Bespin Fizz, Jabba Juice, etc. However my espresso was stone cold so I sent it back, and ten minutes later the one I got was luke(skywalker)warm. So that’s kinda meh, but the Jabba Juice was good. The music was brought by a droid called DJ-REX, who was the pilot droid from the original Star Tours, so it’s awesome they’re still keeping him around, still voiced by Paul Rubin. Music was pretty good too, mix of lots of things, but it all felt like Star Wars cantina music, if that makes sense, as well as Jabba’s palace or something. Some definite Lapti Nek influence. Even played a remix of Cantina Band #2! But the actual cantina itself didn’t scream Star Wars to me (no aliens? Where’s Oga?), and the service could’ve been improved. And the drinks were pricey as fuck.  \\n  \\nThere was a stand that sold blue and green milk. I bought the blue as I’m not a “TRAITOR!”, though the only difference is the colour. It just felt awesome, sitting in an outpost in a galaxy far far away, sipping on that blue just like I’m Aunt Beru. I also appreciated that it was vegan as I am, as well as one or two options for meals. I had the Felucian Garden Spread which was actually really good for theme park food. Imitation meatballs, hummus, veggies, pita. There were other non-vegan stuff obviously, like Ronto wraps, Endorian Tip-Yip Roast, etc.  \\n\\nMaking a theme park full canon is fucking stupid. Here’s why.  \\n- They sell plushies of a genocidal maniac. “Hey, here’s your Hitler stuffie! Also some weird little green guy nobody knows about. And a crime-lord who died 40 years ago.”  \\n- They casually hand out red kyber crystals like that’s completely normal and not complete darkside foolishness. Master Yoda still tells you you’re strong in the force if you have an unnatural crystal that only darksiders use.  \\n- Chewie lends his and Han’s home to a crew of 6 random people’s he’s never met.  \\n- Kylo still has his mask on despite Rey wearing her Ach-To garbs.  \\n- Anyone from the galaxy can just walk into a “secret” store and build a lightsaber.  \\n- The First Order doesn’t care that the ship that blew up a Death Star is casually parked in a market area that’s under their control. It’s not like they wouldn’t recognize it, ESPECIALLY Kylo.  \\n- A shop that isn’t hidden at all casually sells replica sabers of a bunch of old Jedi and Sith, to anyone who wants.  \\n- Is everyone who visits the land canon now as well? Is it canon that I piloted the Falcon? People wearing Mickey Ears? Is the obese woman scootering around canon?  \\n- Blue Milk isn’t actually milk, but rather a sort of blue sweet frozen smoothie sort of thing. Tasty, but makes no sense. And vegan. Is that canon?  \\n- They just sell Han’s dice? How do they know what Han’s dice are?  \\n- They sell rebel flight suits and resistance flight helmets, just to anybody? As well as full Stormtrooper armour (despite the price) to anyone?  \\n- The First Order and the Resistance both occupy the same town cooperatively.  \\n- No aliens or droids ever visit Batuu.  \\n- Kylo Ren enjoys strolling casually though marketplaces on the outer rim.  \\n- Coca-Cola has a soda monopoly even in a galaxy far far away.  \\nHowever, I don’t believe any of this will really influence the movies which is fine, and canon to me is subjective anyway (my canon that is the sequels are bad dreams). The most this park will be acknowledged is probably just a throwaway line about Batuu.  \\n  \\nIn summary:  \\nThe good:  \\n- Immersion and aesthetics  \\n- Lightsaber construction experience  \\n- Character interactions  \\n- Cast members who play along  \\n- Piloting the Falcon  \\n- Awesome merchandise  \\n- Food theming/dietary options  \\n  \\nThe bad:  \\n- Prices. Absolutely ridiculous. I know Disney is bad about this sort of thing typically, but the prices were outrageous here. Especially for someone from Canada where the exchange-rate is pretty bad.  \\n- Sequel-era  \\n- Lack of available and easily-doable roaming characters  \\n- No droids or aliens roaming the land. It would be cool to see a Duros or Weequay buying something at the market.  \\n- Little kids piloting you in the Falcon, scraping along the ground and crashing into literally everything  \\n- Chewie’s costume  \\n  \\n\\nIt’s an immersive Star Wars experience, and despite some gripes I have, it was a really great time that I think any fan of Star Wars would enjoy. I felt like I was in Star Wars, which to me is really all that mattered. Sure, it’s set during the sequels, but the only thing that really tips that off is the FO stormtroopers. Besides that it’s practically timeless.  \\nA crystal chose me, I constructed my own lightsaber, I piloted the Millennium Falcon, I was told to move along, I talked in Shyriiwook with Chewie, I have my own Kowakian Monkey-Lizard jester, Yoda told me I was strong with the force.  \\n  \\nWorth going in my books.',\n",

Background:\\nStarted dating near Thanksgiving, had sex around christmas, were monogamous since sleeping together, and then made the gf/bf official in March 2015.  When we first got together I told him exactly what I wanted, what I was looking for; a partner, love, etc.  He said he was looking for the same thing but was planning to move in the beginning of August.\\n\\nShoot forward to March, I asked if he was seeing other people/ we had the relationship chat, he said no and that he would like me to be his girlfriend he was just worried about moving in August.  Nbd to me, lets take that on when we get to it.\\n\\nFast forward to June/July, I ask how he\\'s feeling, if he wants to stay together, says yes and keeps saying yes up until he leaves.\\n\\nWhat happened:\\n\\nHe moved yesterday, so (naturally) I took the whole day off work to help him pack up his car and spend time with him... and have a good romp in the sheets prior to his two year departure (but we would see one another every month, as planned).  The day went great!  We did the deed, packed his stuff, went for lunch, did some couple shit, it was nice.  \\n\\nDinner time was nearing and I asked him, \"...should I leave?\"  He stated, \"whenever you like.  We won\\'t have dinner for a while.  You can definitely hang out longer if you like.\"  I responded, \"Well I want to hang out with you but I don\\'t want to impose.\" He stated, \"It\\'s my party.... You\\'re fine.\"  Then he asked where my wine was.  \\n\\nGranted I have no reason to believe that meant stay for dinner but he could\\'ve said, \"please leave before dinner I want to hang out with my family etc.\"  But nada, people show up... close friends and some family.  Dinner is around the corner, he disappears for a moment and his mom comes in... in front of everyone, and asks, \"Are you staying?\"  I responded, \" I don\\'t want to impose, it\\'s definitely your decision.\"  She said, \"okay well I didn\\'t plan for you so there is not enough food.\"  I finish my wine and grab my stuff and begin to head out, say good bye to everyone... notice that there is a full tray of lobster tails, baked potatoes, veggies, and salad (enough for over 10 people and there were only 5).  As I\\'m saying goodbye his mom wouldn\\'t even look at me, his friends seemed confused and he acted even weirder.  He walks me to my car, I tell him, \"I\\'ll see you in a month and a half.\" I shut my car door.. he walks into the house... and I\\'m like, \"XNameX, wait!\"  \\n\\nHe comes back out and I start balling, I\\'m so embarrassed, so distraught, and disappointed.  I ask, \"what was that... why did that just happen?\"  He said, \" I just wanted to have family over, (friends were there too)\"  So I follow by stating, \"okay so where does this leave us?  Where are we?  How do you feel about this?\" He states, \"I really really like you, I should\\'ve been more communicative.\"  He says he\\'ll see me in a month and a half, and I\\'m like, \"dude... I drank more, I\\'m not sober enough to drive... I drank a whole bottle of wine, I have to go and park down your street right now until I sober up.\"  He shrugs, says bye, and I said, \"I\\'ll see you in a month and a half.\"  I roll up my window and exit.\\n\\nI feel ashamed, humiliated, disrespected, and like a p.o.s..  He\\'s not the type of person to treat anyone that way... I\\'m just so taken aback.  I don\\'t know if he just broke up with me, those words weren\\'t exchanged... but I wouldn\\'t do that to my worst enemy, let alone my SO. Plus there was not, \"I\\'m sorry...Did you make it home okay?\" :(\\n\\nSo, is this it?  He is just this coward who needs to have his mom do his work for him?  I cannot fathom what brought this on, or what is going on in his mind, any advice would be appreciated!\\n\\nEdit2: HE PAID ME BACK, through venmo and said \"best of luck\" ... Thoughts on that? \\n\\nEdit 1: **11/20/2014-which looking back was more October. No I was not sloshed, pretty far from it, I just drank two in the time of one due to his mom acting when I just poured a glass for dinner.\\nAnd thank you for all the responses! I\\'ve decided to email him about it...I wrote it out, plan to sleep on it, and cut it down (a lot) before I send it. I want to keep it open ended but truly explain how hurtful he was. I\\'m still astonished by his actions and yal\\'s responses totally prove my inkling of \"it\\'s over.\" I\\'m still confuzzled as to why he didn\\'t just...say it? Anywho, thank you again! You guys are amazing and I\\'m truly thankful for the responses, gracias! \\n   \\n**tl;dr**: In summary, I was with my boyfriend all day, helped pack, dinnertime comes.  His mom tells me there was not enough food, and essentially kicked me out. Did we just break up?',\n",
       " 'Top 50 Legend Echo Mage Hello /r/competitivehs community my name is rayc591. Today I want to share with you the Echo mage deck that I used to climb to legend with within the first 5 days of the season. Here is the list I used towards the tail end of my climb https://gyazo.com/a9e6753f2ead1e4e43f80c02f56c0b4c and when I got to legend: https://gyazo.com/640b448078a65bb2bc969516048aa11b and my current rank today: https://gyazo.com/268c365275ccc9a158ce7e8b2c2d2a9e  \\n\\n&amp;nbsp;\\n\\nIf you need more proof I highlighted my whole climb to legend on my twitch channel here: Twitch.tv/rayc591 . \\nThis deck is based off of the Echo Mage used by Neviilz who is arguably the best Echo Mage player out there. He is one of my favorite streamers to watch and helped me learn how to play the deck at a higher level. His guide is also incredibly useful http://www.nevillecaruana.com/top-30-eu-echo-giants-mage-guide/ but my goal here is to help expand on this a bit since the metagame is ever-changing. \\n\\n&amp;nbsp;\\n\\n\\nWhen to play Echo Mage: The best time to play Echo Mage is in a Metagame where Aggro decks and Grim Patron decks are running rampant. Generally, I find the deck to be stronger the lower rank you are. Climbing from 16-5 with this deck is a cake walk most of the time since that is where you will run into Aggro decks the most. The deck can still beat Control Warrior, Druid, Rogue, Priest, etc. but those matchups are probably 50/50 or worse against a player of equal skill.\\nIf this is the case I would feel comfortable cutting 1 Echo of Medivh from the list in order to add a second Illuminator. If you have an Illuminator out with an Ice Block it becomes an instant threat to any Aggro deck that they need to deal with right away since the healing is consistent. This card is slightly better than Healbot against decks like Face Hunter and Aggro Pally when you have it online because it only costs 3 mana and it will almost always be an 8 point life swing for you.  If they do not kill or silence Illuminator the consistent healing will be enough to stabilize your life total and put you in a position to take control of the game.\\n\\n&amp;nbsp;\\n\\n\\nWhen not to play Echo Mage: I am not going too biased towards Echo Mage here: I would straight up avoid this deck if all you are running into on the ladder is Control Warrior and Handlock. A good Control Warrior or Handlock player will be an uphill battle that you will lose a majority of the time. The way they beat you is by never attacking you and letting you go into Fatigue and then one shot you.\\n\\n&amp;nbsp;\\n\\n\\nHandlock can just control the board the whole game and eventually play Lord Jarax and fill their board with 6/6 and one shot you once you get close to fatigue so that way you die through Ice Block. The main way you can win or stand a chance if they know how to play the matchup is to get Sylvanas duplicated multiple times and try to win through that. If the Hand Lock player doesn’t know how to play the matchup it becomes winnable through comboing with Molten Giants and one shotting them etc. if you are lucky.\\n\\n&amp;nbsp;\\n\\n\\nThe Control Warrior matchup is a completely different animal. I think this matchup is winnable against most Control Warrior players since they do not know the matchup. Control Warrior is also the reason why there is only one copy of Arcane Intellect in the deck. Against Control decks you actually want to draw as little as possible since their main goal is to try and bring you to fatigue and then burst you down. If I open with Arcane Intellect and I am playing against someone who knows the matchup I probably will never use that AI since it will only hurt me in the long run. \\n\\n&amp;nbsp;\\n\\n\\nIf you are able to force your opponent to draw 3 off of each of their acolyte while you maintain a decent deck and hand size you can bring them into fatigue so much sooner than them that you can actually win the matchup. \\n\\n&amp;nbsp;\\n\\n\\nIn this matchup if the Control Warrior player will not allow you to play Moltens. You will likely need the extra threats at points in the game so in order to enable your Molten Giants you have to use Alextraza on yourself. I find myself Alexing myself in most control matchups where they do not allow me to play my Molten Giants because you need the extra threats in order to win the game. Again, if they start attacking you and it is obvious they do not know how to play the matchup correctly feel free to draw all you want so you can dig for Moltens and combo off once they get you to a low life total. I find this is the case the majority of the time but once I got to high ranking legend with the deck and the players got better the control matchups became much harder and I needed to play very differently in order to win. \\n\\n&amp;nbsp;\\n\\n\\nIt sounds weird, but I find my playstyle changing drastically based on whether I feel my opponent is going to play the matchup correctly or not. If my opponent is going to play recklessly and lower my life total early I will dig harder for certain things, and be willing to play duplicate with the intent of getting targets duplicated that I may not normally want duplicated. Once you play Echo Mage enough you will start to learn how to play against each deck and develop your own playstyles for each matchup once you play against a certain deck enough. I highly recommend teching the deck out for whatever metagame you are in. I have tried a ton of different variations of Echo mage but I think the base list from Neviilz has been the strongest so far and I would stick with something similar.\\n',\n",

       " 'How I Improved Myself (TL;DR) TL;DR: I was able to change from someone with no confidence and hope for the future, to someone who has more confidence, is 200% happier, and has a beautiful girlfriend and a great group of friends.\\n\\nLooking back on my life 3 years ago, I\\'m glad I was able to become the person I am today. 3 years ago, I was a high school sophomore who had no confidence in myself and no hope for my future. Everyday was just a rush to get through the day because I hated being awake. It took one week in the hospital and rehab for something I will not mention to realize I needed change.\\n\\nI started to see someone about my problems, at first very skeptical. My first therapist was not very helpful, which led me to have a huge anxiety attack and led to me being in the hospital in the first place. However, after giving it another chance, I do not regret that decision. She was always very honest and kind, saying that the friends I had now were not the group of friends I needed in my life. At first it hurt to hear, but then I realized that in that one week of being out of school and out of contact, only THREE out of I say 12 friends bothered to contact my family about how I was doing. Today, those three friends are my best friends. She also said my diet had to change, that I was eating my emotions and although I was a track athlete, it still had an effect on my emotions. Boy was she right: I immediately felt a change in my emotion, as well as my energy. I started losing weight and developed muscle. My self esteem went up tremendously and I felt like nothing could stop me. The last thing she told me and probably the most important lesson of them all was this: \"Forget about everything for a minute. Forget your friends, your family, your teachers, forget everyone. You\\'re looking at yourself through a mirror, do you like what you see? If your answer is no, you know you need change. It wont be easy, you\\'ll hit some bumps along the road, you\\'ll even cry. But it\\'ll be worth it in the end because you\\'ll be someone you can look at and be happy about.\"\\n\\nThat\\'s something I will always carry with me. I\\'m writing this because I want people to believe they can be happy. I want people to know that its not easy to change, that it requires a lot of work to break old habits. But it\\'s worth every minute. Now I\\'m happier than ever, having a great group of friends, starting my second year of college with my amazing girlfriend, and working at a decent job.

       " '(Spoilers All) The \"Sons\" of Mace Tyrell First as a quick refresher, Mace Tyrell has three sons. Willas was crippled by Oberyn during a joust, and stays at Highgarden. We have seen no indication of him getting involved in any military pursuits. He\\'s more into books and breeding his horses and hounds.\\n\\nGarlan, the second son, is given House Florent\\'s seat and lands. He goes to take over his new seat, and then hears of the Ironborn attacks. Last we hear of him, he is raising men in the Reach to retake the Shield Islands.\\n\\nLoras, the youngest, is everything that Joffrey was not, and Cersei hates him. She manipulates him to recklessly endanger himself during the taking of Dragonstone, or so we think. According to the latest information we have received, usually from a Lannister\\'s POV, he is badly wounded, and even possibly on his deathbed.\\n\\nSo those are the three: Willas - disabled, Garlan - mustering men, Loras - on his deathbed. \\n\\nNow, from the epilogue of A Dance with Dragons:\\n\\n\"Mace Tyrell remained unmoved. \\'Once Paxter Redwyne sweeps the ironmen from the seas, my sons will retake the Shields. The snows will do for Stannis, or Bolton will. As for Connington …\\'”\\n\\nSons?\\n\\nSons? Not just Garlan alone? Is Willas Tyrell coming out of Highgarden to lead those forces? I know GRRM has said that we will see more of him in the upcoming books. But would the Tyrells risk the heir to Highgarden on such a mission? Would Olenna countenance it? I don\\'t think so.\\n\\nWhich leaves Loras, who is supposedly on his deathbed, and should not be getting ready to retake much of anything.  Kevan thinks the same thing in the same chapter, just a couple of paragraphs earlier:\\n\\n\"And Ser Loras was young, prone to all the rash judgments of youth, and had been grievously wounded storming the castle besides.\"\\n\\nThere are three possibilities here:\\n\\n1. This is an editing mistake. It should read son.\\n\\n2. Willas will join Garlan to fight Euron\\'s men.\\n\\n3. Loras is not on his deathbed. Either he was not hurt at all, or reports of his injury have been greatly exaggerated, and he is again in fighting shape now. Which would be a confirmation of the Grand Tyrell Conspiracy theory, and would require us to re-read Cersei\\'s AFFC chapters again, to see what other misinformation the Tyrells may be feeding her.  \\n\\nEdit: Got Dragonstone and Storm\\'s End mixed up.',\n",

       " 'The money raised is NOT going to the Filecoin Foundation but Protocol Labs instead? This isn\\'t 100% clear.  If it\\'s going to Protocol Labs, is the deal that is on offer: \\n\\n&gt; 100% fund our for profit Protocol Labs business and in exchange we will give you 10% of the supply of one of Protocol Labs\\' projects?\\n\\nThat seems strange, if that\\'s the case and definitely not clear to me.  Is this an ICO to fund a for profit entity\\'s business plan and NOT to directly fund the development of Filecoin?\\n\\nThat presents many difficult conflicts and agency issues.  I also don\\'t think most potential investors understand this nuance or that is been made clear to them, given that this ICO on Coinlist is titled \"Filecoin\" and not \"Protocol Labs\" and all the documents have come out so close to the security offering.\\n\\nHow do Filecoin investors share in the other projects that Protocol Labs develops?  How can they be assured that Protocol Labs won\\'t spend more time and attention on non-Filecoin projects?  Why is Filecoin being used to fund what looks like a giant blockchain investment fund, Protocol Labs, which is owned by DCG, Naval, Polychain and a few others, and why do those owners get to benefit from the funds raised from Filecoin investors in ways that are much different and expansive than the way that Filecoin investors get to benefit?\\n\\nThis has nothing to do with securities laws, or accredited investors, but just a misleading and confusing fund raise.  If you want to have a raise for Protocol Labs, great, party on, do it directly without obfuscation.  As it stands, Filecoin investors are being asked to fund something other than Filecoin without any of the non-Filecoin upside.\\n\\nOr at least create a legal mandate that all the funds raised in this Filecoin private placement will go to Filecoin development, not to creating a giant blockchain fund held by a few insiders.\\n\\n',\n",

       " 'Twelve biggest WTF moments in all of MGS What can I say?  I\\'m a sucker for these kinda top twelve lists, and when it comes to Metal Gear, there\\'s plenty of \"WTF\" to go around.  :P\\n\\n\\nAnd I\\'m not referring to actual story moments or character motivations or anything like that.\\n\\n\\nWTF refers to moments.  Specific moments when something happens, maybe someone says something or does something, or a thing happens, and I\\'m just left sitting here, blinking dully, before muttered \"WTF.\"  Maybe \"Who the fuck?\"  As in, \"Who the fuck thought that was a good idea?\"  \"Why the fuck?\"  As in, \"Why the fuck am I seeing what I\\'m seeing?\"  Or just the classic, \"What.  The.  Fuck.\"\\n\\n\\nSo, with that in mind, here are my twelve biggest \"WTF\" moments across this series:\\n\\n\\n**12) Seriously, who would even climb that ladder? (MGS3)** - Yeah, I know this moment is beloved by most fans for one reason or another.  But as someone who loves MGS3, I just gotta ask...\\n\\n\\n...Who the fuck would even climb a ladder this sodding tall?  What\\'s the bloody point of making us actively hold the up button f\\'er two minutes straight?  Is Cynthia Hall s\\'posed to make the act of climbing a tedious, impossibly long ladder poignant?  \\'Cuz it ain\\'t.  IMO, this is just one of those \"Kojima moments.\"  Where it doesn\\'t make any kind of sense, but people love it anyway and find reasons for this to have meaning when, really it boils down to this...\\n\\n\\n\"Why the fuck?\"  \"Because Kojima.\"\\n\\n\\n**11) Sins of the Exposition Intermission (TPP)** - This is one of those \"so bad it\\'s good\" moments, IMO.  Skull Face has just done the classic Metal Gear baddy thing where right before the finale, he reveals his entire master plan to the only person who can stop him instead of killing him, and after seven minutes of that, Skull Face takes a break from talking and just chills with Venom while they enjoy lovely intermission from Donna Burke while taking a nice drive across Afghanistan.\\n\\n\\n...I repeat.\\n\\n\\n\"Why the fuck?\"\\n\\n\\n\"Because Kojima.\"\\n\\n\\nWhere else but a Hideo Kojima game would you ever see a moment so legendarily ridiculous?  And really, I actually kinda love this scene for that moment alone.  In some regards, it kinda feels like a commentary on the classic Metal Gear villain.\\n\\n\\nThey spend so sodding long expositing in these moments, and usually, the games try to dress up those massive exposition dumps and make them seem profound and meaningful, when it\\'s just bad writing all around.\\n\\n\\nHere?  Bugger that!  They actively show Venom just sitting there quietly, actively give the player the option to turn on the iDroid and blast the Diarrhea Tape on Speaker where Skull Face is talking, just to drive home the point of how disinterested Venom is.  \\n\\n\\nThink about it, there\\'s never a moment when the player is a passenger in a vehicle, and all the NPC\\'s who sit as passengers are holding rifles in their animations.  It was a conscious decision to mocap Venom so he\\'s barely looking at the evil bellend across from him, and just shifting around.  The game locks out every other option in that scene except iDroid and NVG\\'s.  Venom is the player after all, and he really shows how, most of us probably don\\'t give a fuck when some whacked out twat is barfing their ass backwards logic at us either. \\n\\n\\nAnd then, to cap off all this bollocks, legendary music starts playing over these two rivals just sitting in a jeep staring vacantly at each other.\\n\\n\\nIt\\'s as \"WTF\" as it gets.  It\\'s profoundly stupid.  It\\'s borderline insulting to the characters of Skull Face and Venom, yet, I can\\'t help but appreciate its\\' sheer idiotic, almost intentional satirical brilliance.\\n\\n\\n**10) Why\\'s my radar gone all kinky...? (MGS2)** - Arsenal is one of the weirdest moments in all of gaming, and one of the few highlights of MGS2, IMO.  Crazy Colonel going all crazy is weird and unsettling, but all in the best way possible.\\n\\n\\n...*Then*, we get to that long hallway when we\\'re just flipping around doing naked cartwheels, and our radar turns into this...\\n\\n\\nhttps://i.ytimg.com/vi/eMiyHdZPPhs/hqdefault.jpg\\n\\n\\nYeah, Kojima has never shied away from his pervy side, but this moment is unsettling and weird for different reasons.\\n\\n\\nWe\\'re just standing around, doing naked cartwheels, and the camera lingers on some young Japanese, I\\'m guess, supermodel in skimpy clothes, and she\\'s very into it.\\n\\n\\nAnd like, of all the bloody things to put on our radar when the game is trying to dick with us, Kojima settles on samples from his Spank Bank?  The only thing weirder would\\'ve been Johnny on the toilet, \\'cuz after MGS4, I\\'m about 95% convinced he has a scat fetish and am not as surprised by that as I probably should be... ._______.;\\n\\n\\n**9) \"Boys, get here right meow!\" (MGS3)** - Here, we have another WTF moment that\\'s so unbelievably bad, it\\'s unbelievably amazing.  Ocelot\\'s \\'cat call,\\' *the* Revolver Ocelot, as a twenty year old baby face, meowing.\\n\\n\\nFucking.  *Meowing.*\\n\\n\\nI think Last Days of Foxhound said it better than I ever could:\\n\\n\\nhttp://www.doctorshrugs.com/foxhound/images/foxhound_284.png \\n\\n\\n**8) Gettin\\' kinda grabby, gals... (MGS4)** - Again, we know Kojima\\'s something of a perv, and we know the B&amp;B Unit gals were based off supermodels.\\n\\n\\nThat said, turning every post boss fight against the mechs, into these supermodels fondling some old bloke, crawling all over the floor, then posing for a camera if we take too long?  Really not much need be said.  \\n\\n\\nIt\\'s bloody weird and not in a good way.  More a, \"this is what happens when someone isn\\'t told \\'no\\'\" way.\\n\\n\\n**7) X-Ray Cutscenes (PW)** - On the subject of creeper, much as I like PW, I think it\\'s safe to say Kojima kinda went full blown batty when it came to the female characters of that game.  Every single one of them is objectified in some manner of another, be it stripping them down in Viewer Mode, giving all of them jiggle physics, and letting you see down certain characters clothing in certain cutscenes.\\n\\n\\nThe excuse is ya see the injuries they sustain if you go all the way to the bone.  If ya don\\'t, however, all ya get is Metal Gear gals in their skivvies.\\n\\n\\nSo remind me again why anyone was surprised when Quiet happened...?\\n\\n\\n**6) \"Breathes through her *skin*...\" (TPP)** - What, ya thought we weren\\'t going anywhere by talking Quiet?  Nah, bugger that.\\n\\n\\nLook, I love Quiet.  I think she\\'s an amazing addition, far as gameplay goes, and adds a whole heaping amount of new dynamic to any mission she\\'s a part of.  And she puts any partner we\\'ve ever had in-game to shame, mostly by not sucking.\\n\\n\\nAnd I think she\\'s a strong character with a great side arc.  Going from XOF assassin, to contingency WMD from Skull Face, to actually getting attached to Venom and the player and making the ultimate sacrifice when she realized her silence was unsustainable, feeling the way she felt about Venom.\\n\\n\\nSo it\\'s such a bloody shame that a very strong female character is forever gonna be bogged down because of her lack of attire.  That she\\'ll be remembered as that naked sniper chick and not a strong character.\\n\\n\\nAnd why was that aesthetic choice made?  \\'Cuz she breathes through her bloody skin.  Her lungs were fried, so the parasites chose her skin to act as her lungs.  They also chose for her to do erotic dances whenever she takes in water.  And to occasionally shake her ass in the players\\' face when they wait too long in the helicopter.\\n\\n\\nThis is when Kojima\\'s pervy side stops being funny and just becomes actively detrimental to his own product, and does so completely needlessly.  Would Quiet have been any lessened as a character if she actually dressed like a soldier?  Did we need to be reminded how female Quiet and those sniper Skulls were by constantly lingering on their tits and booty?\\n\\n\\nDoes every sodding female character in these games *need* to be objectified in some way or another? \\n\\n\\nAnd bare in mind, fucking Kojima actually had the gall to say that when we all knew why Quiet looked the way she did, we\\'d all be ashamed of our words and deeds.\\n\\n\\nWell, to that, I think Mr. Montoya has this to say...\\n\\n\\nhttp://www.quickmeme.com/img/9d/9d488c4dd6b949416c85906c5bd7a4c3d3163632d5606a6a068e487c0f3a2d73.jpg\\n\\n\\n**5) Date with Paz (PW)** - Course, off putting as Quiet\\'s treatment was, WTF doesn\\'t even begin to describe this mission, where the objective is ultimately, to get Paz to make peace with Big Boss\\' Naked Snake.  (Technically, his Punished Snake after Kaz.)\\n\\n\\nYeah, it\\'s later revealed that Paz is in her twenties and not a sixteen year old girl, but it doesn\\'t change the fact that she looks underage, she acts underage, and canon or not, BB and the player *think* she\\'s underage. \\n\\n\\nWhat\\'s supposed to be a joke mission just ends up becoming really bloody creepy, and all I can ask is...WTF was going through Kojima\\'s head here?  Or was this another instance where once we knew the truth, we\\'d be ashamed of our words and deeds? \\n\\n\\n**4) Open Stomach Surgery (GZ)** - Sorry not sorry to keep focusing on Paz here, but honestly, IMO, the way Kojima handled her was just way too unsettling and weird, and in the worst way possible.\\n\\n\\nThis was too much for Metal Gear.  To go from BB believing in Santa, to having someone\\'s guts and intestines slowly being exposed as their stomach is cut wide open.  Like, it\\'s gross as shit and just butt-cheek clenchingly brutal, but it\\'s also completely gratuitous.  The sheer gruesome detail borders on gore fetish.\\n\\n\\nAnd the worst part is, the more I think about it, the less necessary this shocking scene really is.\\n\\n\\nLike, ask yourself one question:\\n\\n\\nWhat does this grizzly scene actually add?  Does it distract BB long enough for the attack to happen?  Nah, \\'cuz MSF is gettin\\' blown to tits regardless, and it ain\\'t like Morpho\\'s flying any slower \\'cuz Tara Strong is being viciously ripped open.  \\n\\n\\nDoes it prove how sinister Skull Face is?  No more than...literally everything else he ever does in all of MGSV.\\n\\n\\nDoes it provide a false sense of security for BB to let his guard down?  Again, from what?  MSF is already blown up.  The helicopter\\'s still en route.  And Paz wasn\\'t exactly present enough to say, \"Wait, you idiots.  I have a bomb in my vagina.\"  And if Skull Face needed her alive long enough to blow up in BB\\'s face, why risk killing her early by removing her guts and ripping her open?  Why not just stick with the bomb they already wouldn\\'t have thought to look, and never did look?\\n\\n\\nSorry if this one\\'s a bit too serious.  Promise the rest are just \"*classic* WTF\".  :P\\n\\n\\n**3) The PSG-1 is *where*?!? (MGS1)** - Be honest, was *anyone* happy when Otacon said we had to run all the way back to the bloody armory just to fight Wolf?\\n\\n\\nBacktracking in the first couple MGS games was bad, but MGS1 took the sodding cake with WTF contrived moments to justify them.\\n\\n\\n\"Oh no!  Meryl\\'s been shot repeatedly by a highly trained sniper and is laying there helpless!  I need to do something!  \\n\\n...BRB, Meryl!  Gotsta get me a sniper rifle!  Don\\'t worry, I\\'ll only be like twenty minutes, half an hour *tops*!\"\\n\\n\\nDon\\'t get me wrong, on paper, it\\'s bloody hilarious.  But the actual reality is just sodding tedious.  There was no way to design this boss so we could try and rush our way to Wolf, using cover and trying to reach her so we\\'d be in shooting range?  It *had* to be a sniper fight?  And the PSG-1 *had* to be in that fucking asshole goddamn cunt kicking armory?  And the PGS-1 itself had to have the most terribly designed laser defense system where if you so much as get up the wrong way, it triggers an alert?\\n\\n\\nThis is a whole new kinda WTF IMO.  It\\'s a \"what the fuck did I ever do to make you actively resent me so much, Kojima?\"  \\'XD\\n\\n\\n**2) President Johnson grabs Raiden\\'s Johnson (MGS2)** - I mean...there\\'s so much to say about this moment, that it\\'s almost impossible to quantity everything and everything weird about it.\\n\\n\\nThe more I actually try and think about this scene and how it came into existence, the more I feel my brain seeping out of my ears.\\n\\n\\nSo, I\\'ll just say this...\\n\\n\\nSay what\\'cha will about MGS2, but it really did just fucking *call* the Donald Trump presidency, didn\\'t it.  Not only is fake news more relevant today than it was when this game came out 16 years ago, but it even called the U.S. one day having a president who compulsively grabs pretty blondes by the pussy.\\n\\n\\nSpeaking of brain matter seeping outta ears...\\n\\n\\n**1) \"I live on...through this *arm*!!\" (MGS2)** - Nothing more need be said than that sentence.\\n\\n\\nWhat.  The Actual.  Fucking.  Christ.\\n\\n\\nKojima once stated that he regretted killing off Liquid, \\'cuz apparently, he thinks that giant ham is a complex character.  So, how does he rectify the situation?  Ripping off a Halloween episode of The Simpsons, but instead of Homer getting Snake\\'s hair and being possessed by the prick, it\\'s Ocelot getting Liquid\\'s arm and getting possessed by *that* prick.\\n\\n\\nI mean, do I even *need* to explain why the actual words, \"I live on...*through this arm!*\" is so profoundly WTF degrees of stupidity and borderline insanity?\\n\\n\\nRemember, MGS4 wasn\\'t planned.  MGS2 was s\\'posed to be the \"El Fin\" moment of MGS.  So, with that in mind, after Ocelot got his own hand cut off, he decided the logical course of action was to cut his boss\\' arm off, graphed that onto his stump, and despite *knowing* Liquid is possessing him, refuses a transplant offered by Solidus because something something Frenchmen.\\n\\n\\n\"Nah, mate, occasionally getting possessed by some hammy bellend is just one of those things ya learn to live with!\"\\n\\n\\nIt\\'s funny, but I don\\'t laugh.\\n\\n\\nIt\\'s stupid, but it makes me think.\\n\\n\\nIt\\'s so incredibly bizarre, but in the world of Metal Gear, is about as surprising as a random vampire voiced by Hermes from Futurama.\\n\\n\\nIf that\\'s not the epitome of \"WTF\" in Metal Gear, then truly, I dunno what is.\\n\\n\\nSo, those are my WTF moments.  What were some of your guys\\' biggest WTF moments?',\n",

       " \"Some help with these recipes and flavorings Hey all,\\n\\nI've been lacking inspiration lately, and haven't made a whole lot of DIY. I made a few new recipes earlier in the week, but honestly, I'm disappointed in all of them. I made a peach-lychee flavor, a blueberry/pomegranate/raspberry sour recipe, a honeydew cream, and a sour guava.\\n\\nThe sour blueberry actually turned out pretty good. It needs a little bit of a sweeter exhale, but I got the combination of fruits and sour inhale pretty well. The honeydew cream, I wayyyyy overshot the cream. My first version of the mix didn't have enough cream, so I raised the cream and lowered the fruits, but I overdid both. I think I just need to go back to the drawing board on this.\\n\\nThe peach lychee and sour guava... were just bad. Here's the recipes I used for both:\\n\\n* 8% TFA Guava\\n\\n* 3% TFA Strawberry\\n\\n* 2% TFA Pear\\n\\n* 1% TFA Raspberry\\n\\n* 1% TFA Sour\\n\\nMy intention was to have a predominantly guava juice, with pear and strawberry to round out the sweetness and raspberry + sour to make it... well, sour. Unfortunately, it just tastes bad. The previous recipe (different flavors) I used TFA Guava at 8% and couldn't taste it at all, it was overpowered by grapefruit and pineapple. However here, this mix just tastes nasty. Maybe it's too much guava, maybe it's just other fruits mixing in unpleasant ways, but I don't even think this is worth continuing. Unfortunately, I used the last of my TFA guava mixing it :/\\n\\nAny ideas for where I should start on a sour guava type mix? I'm probably gonna get some more TFA in my next order, maybe another vendor's guava too.\\n\\nAnd the peach lychee flavor:\\n\\n* 5% TFA Lychee\\n\\n* ~3% TFA Strawberry (added later, not sure exact %)\\n\\n* 3% TFA Juicy Peach\\n\\n* 2% CAP Juicy Peach\\n\\n* 1% TFA Koolada\\n\\n* 1% TFA Sour\\n\\nI added the strawberry in after vaping a bit of it... I can't tell whether this is an issue with Lychee or Peach. The exhale tastes almost right - it's kind of a combination of Lychee and Peach gummy rings. However, sometimes the exhale is just downright nasty, and the inhale is generally pretty bad too. I might start this one over with just one flavor of Peach, but I don't really know which one to use. Any suggestions? Also planning to pick up another vendor's Lychee on my next order.\",\n",
       " \"I can finally put a flair by my username!  So this has felt like such a struggle for me, but I think it's finally started to work out. When I first started two months ago, I was exercising like crazy, but then I noticed that I needed to eat better. So then I tried eating better, and started to notice that I wasn't working out at all. It was like a constant tug of war. Then I gave up and quit trying both. Somehow, after a week of not trying at all, I still lost about a pound. So then I decided to try again in moderation. Whenever I ate, instead of worrying about how many calories I was eating, I just made sure I didn't eat as much food. If I made scrambled eggs, then I didn't have toast. If I had Gumbo, I wouldn't get seconds. I also started to tone back how often I workout. Instead of trying to go through a strenuous routine every single day, I try to at least get active for 30 minutes to an hour once every week. I think my problem was that I was trying so hard to loose it, that it was stressing me out. Since I was stressed, even if I was eating something healthy, I would eating too much of it. Today, I weighed myself and I weighed 209 lbs. I had to go back and check to see where I started at, which was 215 lbs. It made me so excited to see that this was actually working out, but I still have a long ways to go. My next goal is to get under 200 lbs. After that, I might try to shoot for abs!\",\n",

I ran for half an hour. My mind was still making a lot of noise so I decided to meditate right after. Because I had disciplined myself with the running I found my meditation session to be much easier and enjoyable and afterward my mind was incredibly clear. It reminded me of a passage from a guide on the eightfold path I read recently. If you engage in unskillful activities it will be harder to clear your mind. And that's it.

       " 'What if the Yugioh chain worked like the Magic stack? Hear me out for a bit here. For the most part, these two concepts work the same way. You build a chain of effects going up, and then resolve them going back down. However, there\\'s a couple of big differences between the two, and I\\'m curious what you guys think would happen if these changes existed in Yugioh.\\n\\n* **Players get to hold priority after adding an object to the chain.** This is one of the biggest ones. Normally, when a player activates an effect in Yugioh, they\\'re forced to give their opponent a chance to respond, before they can activate any other effects. For instance, say Player A activates Torrential Tribute, but before giving their opponent a chance to respond, since Player A activated an effect, they can hold priority and activate an additional Spell Speed 2 or higher effect, like Super Polymerization.\\n* **Objects on the chain can target any other object on the chain.** This is the \"solution\" to the previous change, if you will. Normally, if you activate a card like **Starlight Road**, that card must be activated in direct response to a card that would destroy 2+ cards you control. In Magic, that isn\\'t the case. You could activate Dark Hole, follow it up with three MSTs, and I could activate Starlight Road on your Dark Hole as Chain Link 5.\\n* **Objects can be added to the chain as it resolves.** This is quite possibly the most major change. Normally, when a chain resolves, no player can activate or add effects to the chain until it completely resolves. In Magic, however, cards or effects that meet their trigger requirements as a result of a chain link will automatically trigger and go on the chain, and both players get the opportunity to activate additional effects after each chain link resolves. Think of this example:\\n\\n&gt; Player A activates Fire Formation - Tenki\\n\\n&gt; Player B chains Call of the Haunted, targetting their Thunder-King Rai-oh in the graveyard\\n\\n&gt; Player A chains MST, targetting the Call of the Haunted\\n\\n&gt; Players pass priority, MST resolves, destroying Call of the Haunted\\n\\n&gt; Players pass priority again, Call of the Haunted fails to resolve\\n\\n&gt; Player B does not pass priority, and activates his second copy of Call of the Haunted **while Tenki is still on the chain**, targetting his Thunder King Rai-Oh\\n\\n&gt; Call of the Haunted resolves, and Player A does not pass priority, and instead activates Torrential Tribute in response to the summon of Thunder King Rai-Oh\\n\\n&gt; Torrential Tribute resolves\\n\\n&gt; Tenki resolves\\n\\n* That\\'s absolutely crazy - players get to add effects to the chain as it resolve. Also, there\\'s one big change that would happen as a result of these changes...\\n\\n* **Effects no longer miss the timing for resolving as the last event in chain link 2 or higher.** Because of the fact that effects can be added onto the chain as the chain resolve, \"missing the timing\" no longer should apply in most cases. Sure, **Fire Hand** would still miss the timing when used against a **Soul Taker**, but it would no longer miss the timing when being destroyed by a **Torrential Tribute** as Chain Link 2.\\n\\nObviously, there\\'s some room for thought into how exactly these rules would work (ignition effects shouldn\\'t be allowed to activate in between chains, but trigger effects should), but it\\'s food for thought. Any ideas on how majorly this would warp the game? Maybe new cards become staples, new interactions become more viable?',\n",

I want to try the system with a handful of people in order to tweak it so that it's helpful to more people.\\n\\nIn a nutshell, the book provides actual steps for:\\n\\n- Determining what actions you should take\\n- How to go about performing those actions\\n\\nAnother way to look at it is as a sequence of steps for determining which improvements are worth your while, and how to go about obtaining those improvements. The list of materials are: the *reader*, a pen, a notebook, and an electronic calendar with alerts. The rest is grunt work and persistence (which is what the calendar is for). As you go through the system you also build *safety-nets* along the way to help catch you when you inevitably slip. I put that in because *I* slip, and I can't possibly be the only one. My intent with this systematic approach is to pass through the threshold of *Deciding to be better* and enter *Being better*.\\n\\nTo be clear, what I have is a motivation-deprived, advice-less book with actual steps. It's paced so that you basically read a little bit, do some work, then come back and continue where you left off. The **wrong** way to go about it is to read the whole thing and then try to act on it. That approach would screw everything up because I designed the book to subtly teach multiple things at once so you don't have to hold a bunch of context in your head and then figure out what to do with it. Instead you learn as you do it. This makes for a very short, actionable book. And if you're into doodles, I've got plenty of those. My personal favorite is at the end, but don't skip to it! You gotta... pace yourself :) \\n\\nAnyway, I've got a sample of the book below, which includes the first step of the system. It should give you a pretty good sense of what the rest is like. To reiterate, I'm looking for a few brave souls who want to work with me and try a systematic approach to self-improvement. Personally, I'm tired of accumulating a bunch of knowledge and not knowing what the hell to do with it. So if you find this idea intriguing, take a look at the sample. I added some info about how this pilot is going to be structured to the end of it. \\n\\n[Here's](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B_oUVHo2CEBkVHR2cmJKOUV2Wm8) the sample.\\n\\nThank you,\\nEmmanuel\\n\",\n",

The Survivor votes me and so does 3 other people, but time runs out.\\nD3 there is 2 kills by Werewolf, and I knew it was the Survivor. I try to explain to the high-horsed town that Survivor is a classic Werewolf claim and that lynching him would be a doodle move, but  would be for the safety of town. Once again, failed attempt at getting anybody up on the stand. D4 I get converted, there is one other vamp. (He bit mafia n1.) I still try to get him lynched until they finally put me up on the stand. I try to explain I am Medium and how he is obviously WW. I am lynched. ( I wouldn't of been if the other Vampire innoed. ) D5: More Werewolf kills, Vampire Hunter is resurrected (One of the few people who understand what I was trying to say) and tries to keep up the campaign of getting him lynched. Failed. Next day we finally get him up on the stand and lynched. And behold the Werewolf. At this point there was around 3 vamps. Vampires won. Town was raging and cursing in dead chat. \",\n",

       " '[Advice needed] Home for extended visit, aging Nmom guilt tripping about dying [Updates in comments below]\\n\\nFirst, let me say that I am so glad to have found a community of people who understand how it is like as an ACoN!  Been a reader here for sometime and finally created a new reddit userid to post here. \\n\\nI am in my 30s and only came to understand recently about a year ago that all the pain and confusion I had experienced were a result of Nmom\\' s dysfunction and not mine.  It was a huge realization and turning point - I had thought she may had been suffering from bipolar but after stumbling upon what NPD was on the internet, I felt like for the first time, it was an account of my life growing up with Nmom. \\n\\nFor background, Nmom didn\\'t grow up in a healthy environment herself.  She was fostered by relatives at a young age, and her foster family was very conservative and treated her like the family servant without much freedom or rights.  She herself left that home when she turned 18 but still remained in contact with her foster family and up to this day they still have a hold over her.  \\n\\nMoney was tough when Nmom started a family with Dad. Nmom pretty much raised me as a single parent because Dad was working a job which required living in separate countries, and they did this for most of my growing years.  I am the only child so I grew up having to play the companion role, while being subject to a lot of manipulation and control.  I grew up as the stereotypical \"good\" kid - never gave her any grief, was super submissive (obedient?) and did whatever i was told, got good grades in school, went to good schools, worked in a good job etc. Even when she wasn\\'t physically around, I always felt she was looking over my shoulder so i always felt like i needed her approval in anything i did. In fact i was so \"brainwashed\" that she was a good parent that there was a phase where I actually thought that when i have kids I wanted her to help parent them cos she did a great job with me. How wrong was I!  \\n\\nI started feeling the \"damage\" in my 20s, when I was in college living away from her. I felt paralyzed, almost as if I had arrested development. I feel something was...off.  It worsened after I graduated from college and moved back to a job in the same city where Nmom was. This of course required living under the same roof as her again!  This time though I felt like I was her \"pet\" and she had her own priorities and goals but always needed to keep me on a short leash, show me off to her circle of new friends, partake in the same social activities as her, made me do her work and she then claimed credit for it just so she looked good.  The environment was getting so unbearable and I felt trapped, sick and helpless. I needed to get out so I applied to a bunch of grad schools when i was 30 and got into a great program.  She only relented in \"letting me go\" because it was a reputable program, which of course she could use as more ego fodder.  This followed with a great job opportunity in a city FAR away from her, and it\\'s been 8 years now since I left home for grad school and job and I love my life away from Nmom.  \\n\\nOf course Nmom had to ruin every major achievement within that time, such as going into a narcissistic rage ON GRADUATION DAY because \"I never called home enough\". Then when I took the job to live far away she made a big deal about how she is \"letting me have my fun\" for a couple of years before I had to come home to her again. How I am \"selfish\" to pursue my interests and leave my aging parents. How she cannot understand why I am \"happy\" with my career and life.  How even though I have been in a relationship with an amazing guy for over 10 years I have to keep that a secret from her because she disapproves and thinks we had broken up a long time ago.\\n\\nIn \"exchange\" for being away from home, I implicitly had to agree on 2 things: first, i have to call home twice a week to check in and second, that we spend family time each year.  On the calls, I try to tell myself that for the most part it is on my schedule (rather than she calling me whenever she wants) but she goes into a rage if she doesn\\'t hear from me. On the family time, I visit Nmom for 3 weeks every year (working vacation) which requires living under her roof again. I do that to stop her from showing up at my doorstep, expecting to live in my place and to protect the life I have built for myself. But it sucks!!!\\n\\nEven though I visit every year, this is the first time i am visiting armed with more knowledge about Ns and trying to get the strength to stand up for myself. I am currently now in Nmom\\'s home for my annual trip and it has barely been 48 hours but I am already feeling like an emotional wreck.  The invasive questions about my friends, future plans or finances. The criticism about leaving a \"good thing\" I had going to move away. The \"tasks\" she wants me to do for her.  The endless \"check out how great i am / how good i look\" comments from Nmom about herself. I try grey rocking, but its been hard (as some have mentioned). And the worst is the guilt tripping. She says things like \"you only spend 3 weeks with us every year, if we live for another 10 years that\\'s only 30 weeks.\". Or \"you only have your parents around so much longer\". Or \"what if something happens to us, then will you come back\". Or she\\'d say some iteration of that and then add the comment \"never mind I don\\'t want to talk about it, it makes me upset\". \\n\\nI am struggling with extreme toxic guilt now and I feel so anxious, upset and terrified on the inside. I also feel that shit is going to hit the fan because I wanted to come clean to say I want to be with my amazing bf which will make her absolutely lose it.  I am afraid of the rage as well as the guilt. I am so scared a lot of it is going to deflect to my bf since she already detested the idea of us as a couple.  It feels like it is barreling towards a dramatic showdown or meltdown and I could use any advice or encouragement from the RBN community!  \\n\\n',\n",

It looked like any picture of Mary and baby Jesus, except \\nMary was wearing brown robes with the hood covering her face.*\\n\\n*Sam looked like he was praying. I think that his mother was an american, maybe it\\'s an American thing? Like a splinter church, they have heaps of those in America, don\\'t they?*\\n\\nSo from here on in, things seem to get steadily weirder for Percy. His mother withdraws into herself, she stops going to church altogether (she even skips midnight mass on Christmas, which she\\'s never done before, I know) and starts going on this really weird low salt and all natural diet she stops buying sweets and chocolates (Percy was horrified) she seems to not want any processed foods and such. \\n15^th of December\\n\\n*Mum was talking about moving to a different house with Sam, they stopped talking when I came made a noise, but I think that they were talking about moving into some kind of communal home because she said that she didn\\'t think I\\'d \\'take\\' to living with lots of other kids my age. And the she told him about that time at the Foster home where I punched that kid and smashed all of those plates.*\\n\\nWeird thing, I can\\'t find any cult that are like this. But then they don\\'t exactly publish their practices on the internet.\\n\\n19^th of December 2010\\n\\n*I\\'m getting really worried about Mum, she\\'s so skinny, and she\\'s starting to wear these really strange clothes. She\\'s gotten rid of all of her dresses and clothes, and now she just wears these skirts and shirts, all grey. It\\'s starting to freak me out. She\\'s also taken away all of CDs. Even my Christmas carols, and church hymns. I think that she\\'s going mental*\\n\\n3^rd of January 2011\\n\\n*Alex emailed me. I don\\'t know if I should tell him about the weird stuff that\\'s going on.* \\n\\n7^th of January 2011\\n\\n*I didn\\'t tell him.*\\n\\nThings still get weirder from here on in. Sam cuts off the internet, and Auntie Anna imposes a five o\\'clock curfew on Percy. That\\'s a pretty significant since Percy used to stay out until seven when he was ten years old. These entire were in a separate word document, and protected by a password. Rupert had to mail the USB down to me, and it arrived two days later. It was pretty easy to break the code, it wasn\\'t a very good password password. The journal stops at around February and doesn\\'t start up again until August. Nothing much changes except that Anna gets skinnier, And Percy starts feeling uncomfortable around Sam. Incredibly uncomfortable. He said once that \"he had the eyes of Mr Parks, the same heavy gaze that made you feel like he was about to lock you up in an underground torture chamber,\". Mr Parks (once again, and alias) was a school teacher that Percy had for one year. He was arrested for possessing child pornography and child grooming and Molestation. As you can tell, that\\'s not the most flattering comparison.\\n\\nI think that the next entry is by far the most informative about the cult situation. \\n\\n19^th of November 2011\\n\\n*Last night, Mum got me up at midnight and took me into Sam\\'s freaky praying room. She wouldn\\'t let me speak and told me to get on my knees and pray. Sam was in front of the alter thing, and we were about two meters behind him, kneeling on the ground.*\\n\\n*Sam started chanting, he was speaking in English, but it was weird, like a poem, it didn\\'t rhyme but I could hear the rhythm in the way he spoke. We sat there for what felt like hours, Sam was chanting, and then, still chanting, he started burning something, the smoke was strong and it made me cough and my eyes were watering. The room started swaying and the picture of the hooded figure reached out to me, but now I could see under the hood, it was a man, his face was fixed into an evil smile and his eyes were red and they glowed and pulsed and I felt the sudden surge of terror because I knew, I don\\'t know how, but I just knew, that if he touched me he would drag me down into hell.* \\n\\n*I think that I passed out, because the next thing that I remember clearly was waking up in my bed, and it was nearly ten in the morning. But I know it was real. I still had a strange smell in my clothes from whatever Sam was burning, and there\\'s ash on my pajama knees. But I know it was real and I know who I saw. My mum is worshiping Satan.*\\n\\n*That was last night, today\\'s Saturday, so I\\'m going out. I told Mum that I was going to go for a walk on some of the trails, but I bought some chocolate and a coke (because Mum is going crazy with this new health thing) and caught the bus to [town name withheld].*\\n\\n*I found the church, and went inside to find father Mark. I spent a little while talking about bake sales and how I should come to church on Sundays, or at least the morning tea, because I\\'m missing out on the \\'community spirit\\' and \\'a chance to socialise\\'. This was pretty typical because I only come out once every fortnight for confession and he catches me whenever her can. But eventually we got down to the real problem.*\\n\\nFather Mark asked if I wanted him to hear my confession. I agreed and ran through the whole \\'Forgive me father for I have sinned\\'. I confessed to basics of the last week, lust (It was ridiculous that I could still think about that in my situation) using the lords name in vain. \\n\\nAnd then I decided to just close my eyes and jump, so I spoke. \\n\\n*\"Father, I think that my mum and her boyfriend are worshiping Lucifer.\"*\\n\\n*There was a pause, I guessed that as a small town priest, he didn\\'t hear as much of the wacky stuff that priests in a larger towns or cities had.*\\n\\n*\"What makes you say that?\"*\\n\\n*And  told him. About everything. About the weird shrine room, about my mother\\'s sudden clamp down on my curfew and the internet and the clothes and and the food and how ill she looks and her taking away my CDs.*\\n\\n*\"Are you sure? I don\\'t think that it all adds up to satanism,\"*\\n\\n*\"Yes, but last night... My mum woke me up, and she took me into the room, and Sam started chanting and praying, he was talking about some king and then he burnt something in this bowl and then the painting came alive and he was smiling at me and-\"\\n\\n*\"Percy,\" Father Mark cut me off. \"Are you sure that this wasn\\'t a dream brought on my your stress? \"*\\n\\n*\"No, I know what I saw, Father, whatever it is that he\\'s doing, it\\'s not natural,\" After that, he was silent for a long time. He told me that he needed to do some reading, but I should come back later and talk to him. So I did my Hail Marys and went out to buy lunch.*\\n\\n*When I came back, Father Mark told me that he couldn\\'t find any references to what I was talking about. He suggested that I ask my mum exactly what was going on. I have to admit, he kind of has a point. I\\'ll do that.*\\n\\nAfter this, Percy stops writing much. It\\'s mostly just a very bland overview of each day. There\\'s nothing of much interest for the next few months, I don\\'t think that it\\'s a very accurate description of what actually happened. If fact I don\\'t know if it was even written by Percy in the first place. It doesn\\'t have the quality that I\\'ve come to associate with my cousin\\'s writing. And he doesn\\'t mention asking his Mum or Sam anything. It\\'s weird. Maybe Percy hid he rest of his journal somewhere else. \\n\\nI\\'m afraid that I can\\'t upload the journal for you guys to ponder over. First of all, it\\'s obscenely large  and would take you literally forever to read. And Percy has a lot of issues, and he\\'s quite expressive in his journal and I don\\'t think he\\'d appreciate me publishing his journal for the world to see. It\\'s bad enough that *I* read it, if I published it on the internet I think he\\'d flip.\\n\\nAnyway, I\\'ve been reading up on cults and I\\'ve read up on satanic cults in particular, and I was watching this YouTube video about this girl who was used as a baby maker for her father to sacrifice at his rituals and I\\'m seriously freaked. So now you guys are up to date, what do you think? \\n\\nAnd  I\\'m going to look into cheap flights and hotels in Scotland...',\n",
       " 'JS Summary So let me see if I can get this right: Joseph Smith was a well known treasure digger from a family that itself was well known for being superstitious and constantly looking for a get rich quick scheme. We know that nobody ever really saw the gold plates. We know that the gold plates were not used in the \"translation\" of the Book of Mormon. We know that the Book of Mormon bears striking resemblance to other contemporary books, especially one that Joseph Smith\\'s chief scribe, Oliver Cowdery, was quite familiar with. We know Joseph Smith plagiarized much of his \"translation\" of the Bible. We know that Joseph Smith was blatantly wrong in his \"translation\" of the Book of Abraham. We know that Joseph Smith was fooled by the Kinderhook plates hoax. We know that Joseph Smith never told anyone about the so-called \"first vision\" until over a decade after it happened, and after the church had been formed, and then changed his story about it several times before he died. We know that he used his position of power to rape and sexually assault many women and girls, and used that power and influence to trick many women and girls into \"marrying\" him, regardless of their age or current marital status. We know that he plagiarized much of the temple endowment from masonry. We know that he engaged in an illegal banking scheme. We know that he ordered the destruction of a newspaper printing press after it printed the truth about his secret polygamy. Yet we are supposed to believe this is the guy \"God\" chose to be his so-called \"prophet\"? Is that about right?',\n",

       " \"UHC Metagame UHC has grown to be a huge deal for the Mindcrack server. It helps cross-pollenate people, incites lots of activity on the subreddit, and is one of the first things people think of when a new feature is added (tripwires, new enchanting system, invisibility potions). The game of UHC has changed over time as well, with different strategies and techniques. UHC as it stands is pretty close already to having a metagame, which I think is pretty cool and interesting.\\n\\nI think that with some amount of tweaking, different strategies could be balanced. As it stands right now, there are a few different strategies that have been used:\\n\\n* Playing an offensive game (going caving only for iron and maybe one golden apple, then roaming the surface trying to find people).\\n\\n* Playing defensively (going caving more to find stuff like diamonds, more gold than you need, and stuff like melon seeds)\\n\\n* Going to the nether to hunt for ghasts (a more reliable method for finding much needed gold, requires arrows to work)\\n\\n* Going to the nether to find blazes (similar to finding ghasts, except it requires more starting health and is more dangerous)\\n\\n* Setting traps (a supporting strategy that is most useful when the trap is quick to set up and deadly)\\n\\nNow at the moment, the best strategy seems to be playing defensively at first, then offensively once you are equipped. The nether is almost always too high of a risk for the reward, and is rarely gone to. Most people don't set traps, or if they do, the trap is too complicated and takes too long to make. So in order to balance the strategies, some tweaks would be needed. Some ideas are:\\n\\n* Chickens dropping more feathers (maybe dropping 1-3 feathers and 0-1 meat)\\n\\n* More chickens (perhaps replacing sheep or ocelots which are unused)\\n\\n* Easier to access flint (maybe making a 50% chance of turning into flint unless you use a shovel, which would make it a 0% chance)\\n\\n* Cobweb generated inside of caves (would probably be quite rare, maybe enough so that you only find 1-3 in a normal cave, in order to make spider string still be worth something)\\n\\n* Different villager trades (better buying deals (~10 wheat = 1 emerald) and cheaper selling prices (1 emerald = 8-10 arrows), could be tweaked a lot)\\n\\n* Better ghast/blaze drops (dropping more gold or blaze rods to offer a bigger incentive)\\n\\nI could probably keep listing tweaks like this for days, but this should give you an idea. It would be a lot of work to balance, but it would be cool if accomplished. I just thought it was an interesting idea, and wanted to share it.\\n\\nTL;DR Tweaking the UHC mod to make strategies balanced.\",\n",

       " 'Why I fear sex I had a breakthrough the other day in therapy: I realized where my fear, hatred, and distrust of sex as a male comes from. Maybe this is dumb, maybe it won’t help anyone else, but on the chance that it might, I might as well post it.\\n\\nBackground: I’m a 40-something dude from a very devout Catholic family (I became an atheist as a young adult). I endured a 10-year dead bedroom marriage (wife wasn’t interested), and I’m currently married again and again facing a dead bedroom situation – my fault this time, as I’m struggling with all aspects of sex and intimacy. I pretty much hate myself and all of my past relationship and sexual choices.\\n\\nI feel like I’m a pretty typical heterosexual male in that I have a rush of testosterone whenever I see an attractive female. It’s normal, and it means everything’s working correctly – and it is thrilling, this is nature’s way of perpetuating the species. I’ve had those feelings as long as I can remember: in preschool, in kindergarten, all the way back. Maybe I was precocious. I suspect not.\\n\\nPretty soon, though, I began to suspect that those good feelings were actually bad. The Catholicism I was raised in absolutely believed in original, mortal sin – the sin of sex. From an early age, I was told NEVER to touch my dirty parts, that I was bad for having lustful thoughts, that coveting something was as bad as murder. \\n\\nThe thrill I got when I saw a girl became a source of shame. And it still is, and will probably always be. Thank you, religion. Thanks, mom and dad. But you can’t stop it from happening if your body works right. I think this is maybe why some guys overeat, smoke, do drugs – to kill their bodies and make themselves “good.” Maybe it’s even why some men become misogynists – they can’t control the evil thrill, and so they blame the women who make them feel it.\\n\\nIn my case, more crap got piled on top of it. In college, I learned from the feminists that all men were potential rapists, or not so potential. The thrill, besides being a reminder of my shame, also became a warning to myself that I could commit rape at any time, I guess.  And now that I’m over 40, the thrill when experienced in reaction to seeing a much younger woman makes me feel like a pervert and a dirty old man.\\n\\nI doubt I’ll ever get over this feeling, and it’s probably too late for me anyway at my age. It might not be too late for others. Trust the thrill. There doesn’t have to be anything behind it. It’s just your body doing what it’s designed to do.\\n\\nTL;DR: Religion and society hate testosterone.',\n",

Now by coincidence a certain priest was going down along that road, and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side. A Levite likewise came down to the place and saw him, and passed by on the other side of the road. But a certain Samaritan, as he traveled along, came down to where he was; and when he saw him, he was moved with pity and sympathy for him, And went to him and dressed his wounds, pouring on them]oil and wine. Then he set him on his own beast and brought him to an inn and took care of him. And the next day he took out two denarii two day’s wages and gave them to the innkeeper, saying, Take care of him; and whatever more you spend, I myself will repay you when I return. Which of these three do you think proved himself a neighbor to him who fell among the robbers?” He answered, “The one who showed pity and mercy to him.” And Jesus said to him, “Go and do likewise.”\\n~ Luke 10: 30-37\\n\\nToday, in the United States, there are over 14 million homes that are state/bank owned that are sitting vacant. Currently, there are over 600,000 homeless human beings living on the streets of the U.S. \\n\\nWhile Christians do not live according to Old Testament law; there is much to be learned from it. \\n\\n“All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting, and training in righteousness, so that the servant of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work”\\n~ 2 Timothy 3: 16,17\\n\\nIn the OT there was a law regarding a celebration that the ancient Israelites were to have every fifty years called Jubilee. \\n\\n“Consecrate the fiftieth year and proclaim LIBERTY throughout the land to all its inhabitants. It shall be a jubilee for you; each of you is to return to your family property and to your own clan”\\n~ Leviticus 25: 10\\n\\nDuring the year of Jubilee ALL debts were cancelled and the land was returned to any who had lost it or to their dependents regardless of why the land had been lost. \\n\\nThe law that the modern Christian is supposed to adhere to is the law of Law of Love as taught by Christ in the New Testament and later elaborated upon by the Apostle Paul. \\n\\n“Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength. ‘The second is this: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself. ‘There is no commandment greater than these.” \\n~ Mark 12: 30,31\\n\\n“Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted. Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the earth. Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled. Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy. Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God. Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God. Blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are you when people insult you, persecute you and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of me. Rejoice and be glad, because great is your reward in heaven, for in the same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you”\\n~ Matthew 5: 3-12\\n\\n“Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Love never fails.”\\n~ 1 Corinthians 13: 4-8\\n\\n“And as you would like and desire that men would do to you, do exactly so to them.”\\n~ Luke 6: 31\\n\\nIt is my position that a merciful and just society would never tolerate or turn away from 600,000 homeless human beings while banks sit on billions of dollars’ worth of unused real estate. Further, I believe that the day that the state falls and the banks, which are an apparatus of the state, fall with it, will be a year of Jubilee for all and all debts will be cancelled. If the banks are no more, who will come to claim the mortgage on my own home? And what of those who live on and work the land that feeds billions around the world, but, because of state privilege given to major multi-billion dollar corporations would never be able to claim ownership of the land that they pour their own sweat, blood, and tears into? I say, let all debts be cancelled and let the land and all unused real estate be returned to the people from whom it has be stolen. The land to the farmer and the factory to the worker. Let these empty homes be occupied by those who are now homeless and let the occupiers claim ownership. And why? Because it is morally just, that is why. \\n\\n\"To be free means to be acknowledged and treated as such by all his fellowmen. The liberty of every individual is only the reflection of his own humanity, or his human right through the conscience of all free men, his brothers and his equals.\\n\\nI can feel free only in the presence of and in relationship with other men. In the presence of an inferior species of animal I am neither free nor a man, because this animal is incapable of conceiving and consequently recognizing my humanity. I am not myself free or human until or unless I recognize the freedom and humanity of all my fellowmen.\\n\\nOnly in respecting their human character do I respect my own. A cannibal who devours his prisoner is not a man but a beast. A slave owner is not a man but a master. By denying the humanity of his slaves he also abrogates his own humanity, as the history of all ancient societies proves. The Greeks and the Romans did not feel like free men. They did not consider themselves as such by human right. They believed in privileges for Greeks and Romans and only for their own countries, while they remained unconquered and conquered other countries. Because they believed themselves under the special protection of their national gods, they did not feel that they had the right to revolt and themselves fell into slavery....\\n\\nI am truly free only when all human beings, men and women, are equally free. The freedom of other men, far from negating or limiting my freedom, is, on the contrary, its necessary premise and confirmation. It is the slavery of other men that sets up a barrier to my freedom, or what amounts to the same thing, it is their bestiality which is the negation of my humanity. For my dignity as a man, my human right which consists of refusing to obey any other man, and to determine my own acts in conformity with my convictions is reflected by the equally free conscience of all and confirmed by the consent of all humanity. My personal freedom, confirmed by the liberty of all, extends to infinity.\"\\n\\n-Mikhail Bakunin\\n\\nLet there be no more turning away. Let us, instead, be a people of mercy. ',\n",

In that time period, I went into a sort of \"self-reboot\" mode. I looked at myself and said \"Yeah, losing weight is one thing, but get your fucking life in order, man.\" I asked for the raise I\\'ve been pussyfooting around for the last few months. Got the raise. I cleaned out/washed my car, my room, kitchen, etc. My girlfriend hasn\\'t even seen my new apartment, but it makes me feel better knowing things are in order.\\n\\nI joined a gym, did some research on various fitness/weight lost subreddits, and tinkered with my diet. I stopped drinking during the week, which has helped my wallet significantly. I\\'ve lost about 12 pounds in the last month! There\\'s been some give and take as I gain muscle, so the scale isn\\'t super helpful, but I work out in a sweatshirt so I\\'ve lost a considerable amount of water weight, which has made my face look MUCH thinner.\\n\\nFor the girlfriend -- It\\'s like she\\'s never been more attracted to me.

It took some reluctant communication, awkward moments, and really tough honesty, but that level of transparency in the relationship is worth saving it. \\n\\nAlso, my closing advice for anyone else in a remotely similar situation: Encourage strong communication, and be honest.

The soldier stabs a bag of corn/grain instead and the food spills out from beneath the door, tricking the soldier for some time. However I think the person is possibly found out? The movie possibly took place during World War 2 but that’s a guess.',\n",
       " 'Host evicted 2 months ago My husband booked the top floor of a duplex in early May for a stay in early August. All reviews looked good, got a message the week of our stay with check in instructions (rear stair entry, lock box).  Showed up, no lock box. Host phone goes straight to VM, no response to messages. Customer service, after about 15 minutes of run around, says we have to give him 30 minutes to respond. At this point, it has been 16 hours since we woke up, we are tired and sweaty and just want to change clothes and chill. During this time, my husband pulls up the listing again and sees a sudden shift in reviews starting in June. It appears that the host was actually renting the unit and had been evicted. Over 5 negative reviews over the past two months. \\n\\n[Reviews](https://imgur.com/gallery/rRqQUUR)\\n\\nWhen support calls back after 30 minutes, they offer a refund and an $11.22 coupon. They had no answer to why the reservation was not cancelled. Evidently the host is not in the system anymore, but they didn’t cancel our reservation because it is all automated? Waiting for a call back from a supervisor. Any suggestions? This put a big damper on our kid free weekend and I’m going to have a hard time selling my husband on any future rentals. \\n\\nAt least we found a place. 🔥wire to the rescue!',\n",

       " \"[NSV] [SV] Keto is already changing my life... I work in an office so I sit at my desk for most of the day. Prior to starting keto my work skirts had been increasingly getting tighter and tighter (most I can no longer even fit into). Yesterday I noticed that my skirt was gaping at the back. I was like whaaaaat? Surely I'm imagining it. Then I realized that my skirt wasn't digging into me at the front like it usually does.\\n\\nI took some measurements this morning and I have lost 2 inches from my waist. 2 freaking inches. I'm only on day 10 of keto! I've lost almost 10 pounds already but I assumed that was mostly water weight but boy was I wrong. My thighs are even down .75 of an inch! That is a big deal for me as my thighs are my worst problem area and even when exercising they are the last thing to start shrinking. This is like magic ha-ha.\\n\\nI know it's only very early days for me but I honestly feel like a million dollars. My skin is looking great, I don't feel like a cranky cow after work (my fiance has noticed my improved mood), and this may be TMI but my libido has improved. I have been struggling in that area for what seems like an age, but things are really improving there already. Maybe that's just because of my new attitude though?\\n\\nI can't wait to see what other changes are in store. Keto rules. I'm curious, have any other ladies found an increase in libido since starting keto?\",\n",

       " 'the complain free meditation...(a way to be SUPER freakin happy :) ) So I am known by my friends as \"the guy who is always happy.\" At first I thought is was a jab at me or that my happiness annoyed them, but I later found out that people looked forward to me coming around.\\n\\nAnd the most frequent question I get is, \"How are you always so fucking happy?\" (sorry if the cursing offends you but it makes me happy :) ) \\n\\nAnd so I tell them.\\n\\nThe way I look at it is, if my friends and the closest people around me wanted to know what I do in order to be happy I figure others might want to know as well.\\n\\nNow, this is not the end-all be-all of how to be happy. Or that I am saying my way is the best and ONLY way to be happy. I am just sharing how I get myself into a pleasant, joyful mood and maybe...just maybe, it might work for you :) .\\n\\nLike the Universe, I like things in 3\\'s. BUT for now, I will only write about one of the techniques I use. So here is ONE of the...\\n\\n3 Steps to Smiling Your Ass Off &amp; Consequently Attracting Everything Good You\\'ve Ever Wanted :)\\n\\nStep 1:\\nThe \"Stop Fucking Complaining\" Meditation\\n\\nNo one likes to hear you complain, especially the Universe. Why does the Universe hate it when you complain? Because you\\'re pretty much telling the Universe, \"Right now sucks, back then sucked, and I\\'m sure later will suck!\" This is telling the Universe it sucks big donkey balls at doing its job. If right now is \"wrong\" then that means the whole Universe must be wrong. Stop looking at your present moment as \"wrong\" and open your eyes. Right now is BEAUTIFUL, WONDERFUL, HUMOROUS, JOYFUL, and ABUNDANT!\\n\\nThe Universe hears your complaints and says, \"OK wise guy, you want to complain? I\\'ll give your more reasons to complain about. Take sickness, BAM! How about a little flat tire, BOOM! And while I\\'m at it I\\'ll send over that annoying HR witch Francine to \"coincidentally\" run into you an talk about her 30 cats for an hour.\\n\\nYou see? The Universe is tired of hearing you complain.\\n\\nDo this: stop complaining for one minute. \\n\\nI\\'m serious, for one whole minute. Stop complaining.\\n\\nThis can be a super short one minute meditation.\\n\\nToo easy right? Good, I want it to be easy. The easier the better. But here is the kicker. You have to stop complaining ALL TOGETHER. As in, no complaining in your speech, your thoughts, your emails, Facebook, Twitter, and in your actions. Yes, you can complain with body movement. Eye rolling sound familiar?\\n\\nBe honest with yourself during this minute.\\n\\nThe goal is to stop the complaining FEELING. The complaining feeling that runs through your entire being is a major reason you are unhappy. To stop that feeling we must stop complaining all together.\\n\\nAnd we start with one minute.\\n\\nThen after your mastered one minute of non-complaining go for 5. Then 15. Then 30. Then....ONE WHOOOOOLE HOUR. This can be in a meditative state or just going about your day. (its best to start in meditation as there are no outside events to sway you to complain, but after you can meditate for while in a complaint free zone, then you MUST go about in the world in a complaint free state. Because quite frankly, you live IN the world.)\\n\\nIf you can stop complaining for one whole hour, each and every day, your life will automatically start shifting to a happier, more joyful state. I promise you that.\\n\\nI know, because I did this technique and it has made my life wonderful. I now love every moment that I have in this life. This life is an amazing gift with twists and turns that sometime we cannot comprehend at the present moment. That doesn\\'t necessarily make them, \"wrong.\" And I can see that now.\\n\\nBy reducing your complaints, you are telling the Universe that right now, this moment and every moment, is \"right.\" The Universe is \"right.\" Right now is RIGHT. Right now is perfect. There are no imperfections to me right now. Right now is wonderful and perfect.\\n\\nThe Universe will then say, \"Your gosh darn right, this moment is perfect. And since this moment for you is complaint free, I will send you more moments that are complaint free. Like, here\\'s a detour you\\'ll be forced to take on the way home from work that will lead you through the most wonderful street of flowers. Or, here\\'s a long line at Chipotle that turns out amazing because you meet a hot girl/boy who you exchange an amazing conversation with...plus it\\'s already amazing because you\\'re at Chipotle.\"\\n\\nThe less you complain the happier you become and consequently get more things to NOT complain about.\\n\\nNot only that, but the people around you start to stand you :)\\n\\nStop fucking complaining for one minute. I promise you, your life will change.\\n\\nAnd if you cannot find a way to not complain for a minute, then go to Chipotle and eat a burrito bowl. You won\\'t complain that whole time :)',\n",

       " 'Converting a PF game to DW Hello all; I just discovered Dungeon World and I think I\\'m in love. I\\'ve been playing Pathfinder for a long time, but DW is the game I never knew I always wanted to play! \\n\\nI\\'m currently running a game of PF. We are running through Rise of the Runelords; the PCs are halfway through clearing out thistletop. I realized I\\'m just not having fun. I had never run a pre-con adventure before, I used to keep the world open (\"leave blanks!\") until now, and I found I\\'m always worried about contradicting the cannon/the story to come. Plus my players are very imaginative and cinematic and I feel like this change would help me to not have to say \"no\" so much when they want to pull crazy stunts. I would love to get rid of turns and grids. The conversion appendix has some awesome advice, and eon\\'s guide is great, but I thought I\\'d ask here too. \\n\\nI\\'m thinking that when they\\'re done clearing out thistletop I would really like to convert the game to DW, open it up, and for the most part forget the rest of Rise of the Runelords in favor of a more open world. That said, I\\'m trying to figure out what fronts there are. The characters are connected to sandpoint by now, so I figure I can make one front the deep dark evil down below the town, and another maybe the goblins banding together again, and maybe some new threat coming down from the hinterlands (orcs, giants, etc.). There\\'s also the small time criminals in Sandpoint, maybe they\\'ve got big plans; or maybe there will be another Chopper.\\n\\nMy PCs are a human rogue (easy), a half-elf paladin (I don\\'t think he needs a special move, the human one is probably fine, but I\\'d ask him what he thought), a dwarven druid (probably could parallel the elf trait but for mountains instead of forests), and a half-orc wizard (I\\'m not sure what ability to give him, maybe higher damage?).\\n\\nDo you guys have any suggestions? Obviously I\\'m not an experienced DW GM, so I\\'d love any input you guys might have! Thanks!',\n",

       " 'Your first kiss should be over the altar at the temple My bishop as a teenager told this to the YW in his semi-annual chastity lesson. He would say something like, \"The prophet has asked us to go the extra mile. I encourage you sisters to not just keep the standards in the For the Strength of Youth pamphlet, but really commit to them. How wonderful would it be if your first kiss was with your husband over the altar at the temple? You could tell him that you were so committed to your future temple marriage that you saved all of your kisses for him.\" \\n\\n\\nMost of us thought this idea was ridiculous, but a few of the YW took it seriously, especially the bishop\\'s daughter, Wendy, who was a few years older than me. She was my older sister\\'s best friend, very sweet and quiet, but also more Molly Mormon than any sane person should be. She took her dad\\'s advice very seriously and was always shocked when she saw other youth kissing or talking about it. She was going to save all of her kisses for her future RM husband.\\n\\n\\nSeveral years later, Wendy and I lived in the same apartment complex at BYU and ended up spending a lot of time together. She still had virgin lips and hadn\\'t really dated anyone. One semester she found herself the love interest of 2 different guys in our ward. One, Steve, was shy like her. The other, Ryan, was more confident and outgoing. She liked them both, but Ryan asked her out first, so she began dating him. After dating for about a month, she prayed about Ryan and felt that their relationship was headed towards marriage, so she took the plunge and let him kiss her. Of course Wendy was a good mormon girl, so they would only kiss at the end of a date and never for more than 3 seconds.\\n\\n\\nAbout a week after their first kiss, Wendy found out that she wasn\\'t the only girl Ryan was dating and kissing. They broke up and she was devastated. How could she have so carelessly given away kisses meant for her husband to another man?!? (yes, that is exactly how she phrased it while we ate ice cream and I consoled her on her breakup)\\n\\n\\nThe next week, Steve asked her out on a date. They dated for a short amount of time, then got engaged. He was a better match for her than Ryan anyways. The week before her wedding, she told me that she needed to talk to me about something important. She asked me not to ever tell anyone that she had kissed Ryan. Her fiance thought that she had never kissed anyone and they were saving their first kiss for their sealing. Other than Ryan, I was the only one who knew she did not have \"virgin lips.\" (LOL) I promised Wendy that I would take her secret to my grave, all while feeling like a horrible slut because I had already kissed 3 boys by that point in my life. Wendy and Steve got married, had a bunch of kids and are still happily married (at least from what I can tell). I bet she tells her daughters all the time that her first kiss was over the altar in the temple and they should do the same and her bishop dad (now in the stake presidency) is still bragging about his daughter that saved her first kiss for her husband. \\n\\nTL:DR My friend kissed another man before she started dating her husband, lied about it and claims her first kiss was at her sealing.',\n",

       " 'Ko Ga\\'s Beginner\\'s Guide Part 1 As the launch and head start of Guild Wars 2 quickly approaches millions of players will be launching themselves into the world of Tyria. Although the game has come leaps and bounds on giving players a heads up and some tips on how to play many still find themselves realizing there is a lot more to know. I\\'m not talking about the depth of the trait lines, or the various combinations of utilities and weapons here though. This is for the minute you step out into that greater world after the tutorial and is meant to help ease you into the experience with some tips and tricks that will get you on your way fast. \\n\\n\\nFirst things first, you just stepped out of the tutorial and you find yourself outside your home city. You have a couple options here:\\n\\n\\nYou can head in and explore the city. \\n- Finding waypoints/vistas, unlocking parts of the map, looking for points of interest, or just generally familiarizing yourself with the city.\\n\\nYou can run out into the world and look for your first heart quest (as the game suggests)\\n- This will bring you to a renown heart and afterwards your personal story will direct you back to the city anyway.\\n\\nYou can throw screen tips to the wind and keep exploring, fighting, helping, and leveling.\\n- There\\'s really nothing that says you have to go back to town if you don\\'t want to. Tyria is a big world and you can play it how you want to.\\n\\n\\nHmmm, but Ko Ga... I don\\'t have enough room in my inventory for all this stuff, and how do I harvest these trees, mine this rock or grab those herbs?\\n\\n\\nYou\\'ll want to head to the merchants that are right near where you first left the tutorial outside your home city. \\n\\n\\nThere may be a few different merchants selling different wares, but one of them will sell cheap bags and the lowest level gathering tools. You\\'ll need at least a small bit of coin (not much at all) before you head to these merchants but the extra bag space will help repay for itself quickly. Keep in mind as an alternative, with only a small amount of materials and no real world knowledge of crafting you can make larger bags/boxes by just signing up for a craft in town and crafting a bag or box right off the bat. (Extra tip: click on the gear icon in the upper right hand corner of your inventory and click \"deposit all collectibles\". This will instantly place all the collectible items (i.e. crafting mats, etc) currently in your inventory into your bank) As for those gathering tools, even if you don\\'t plan to craft, HARVEST! \\n\\n\\nHarvesting in GW2 yields not only materials but also experience. Even if you don\\'t plan to craft, HARVEST. Yes, I know I just said that but here\\'s why. Materials can be used for crafting, even if you don\\'t plan to craft others will. You can quickly and easily put these materials up on the trading post (accessed by hitting \"O\" [default]). If the market doesn\\'t interest you, then you can always sell the items to a merchant for coin. Either way harvesting will quickly pay for itself in both coin and experience gained. \\n\\n\\nOkay, so you\\'ve got extra bag space, you\\'ve got harvesting tools and you\\'re making use of what you\\'ve got. Now what?\\n\\n\\n*\"These darn dead monsters keep sparkling at me\"*\\n\\nLOOT!, Loot, and then loot some more. Picking up everything, including the grey items, is the fast road to more coin in your pockets. (Making use of the aforementioned \"deposit all collectibles\" option will give you more room for more loot.) I know inventory management isn\\'t the most fun, but following these few things will make it a bit easier. (Extra tip: Hit escape and enable the box for \"area loot\". This will make picking up loot faster and easier, spam that F key on those bodies!)\\n\\n\\n*Weapon Vendors*\\n\\nAll around Tyria you will find weapon vendors. Mostly you will be able to attain your weapons through drops but these vendors can be really handy for getting all your weapon skills unlocked. Especially in the early game. You can find them in major cities and larger outposts around the map and they will show up on your map as sword icons.\\n\\n\\n*What does \\'Salvageable\\' mean?*\\n\\nAlways try to carry salvage kits with you. They can be purchased from the same merchants that sell the base bags and harvesting materials. If you get an item that says it is salvageable this means you can use a salvage kit on it to get materials that are usually worth more than the item itself. As before you may put these materials up on the Trading post or sell them to a merchant for extra coin. \\n\\n\\nNote: Pay attention to what your harvesting tools and salvage kits are capable of by reading the in-game tool tip!\\n\\n\\n*Karma, Karma, Karma!!!*\\n\\nWhile doing dynamic events you\\'ll notice that you gain coin, experience, and a currency called Karma. What is Karma? Karma is used to purchase items from renown heart NPCs who become vendors once you\\'ve filled their heart. It is also used to purchase other things later on, but for now I\\'ll divulge their early game importance. You may notice that early on a lot of the renown vendors will be selling trinkets, accessories, and rings. This may seem strange but it can be a good boost in stats during the early game experience. All of your stats are coming from your level, armor and weapons. The accessory slots to the right, above the slots for your harvesting tools, start out empty. By having even a simple ring that does +3 to power your character will be doing that much more damage, or by having a trinket/accessory that does +3 to toughness you\\'ll take that much less damage. (Not exactly +/- 3 when calculated, but I\\'ll get to that in a minute.) This will make your early game experience that much smoother.\\n\\n\\n*What do all these stats mean?*\\n\\nHere is a basic description of the 4 primary and 5 secondary attributes.\\n\\nThe four **primary** attributes are: \\n\\n[Power](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Power) - Each point increases the attack statistic by one, which increases damage for all attacks.\\n[Precision](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Precision) - Each point increases the chance of a critical hit for the character. \\n[Toughness](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Toughness) - Each point increases the armor of the character by one, which improves the character\\'s ability to withstand direct damage.\\n[Vitality](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Vitality) - Each point increases the maximum health of the character by ten hitpoints.\\n\\n\\nThe five **secondary** attributes are:\\n\\n[Boon Duration](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Boon_Duration) - improves the duration of all boons applied by the character.\\n[Condition Damage](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Condition_Damage) - improves the damage dealt by conditions your character inflicts.\\n[Condition Duration](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Condition_Duration) - improves the duration of all conditions inflicted by the character.\\n[Critical Damage](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Critical_Damage) - improves the damage multiplier on critical hits.\\n[Healing Power](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Healing_Power) - improves all healing performed by the character, including healing from the regeneration boon.\\n\\n\\nBoons are positive effects with limited duration, the counterpart to the negative conditions. (i.e. regen)\\nA condition is a negative effect that can be inflicted against enemies through the use of skills and affecting traits. (i.e. poison)\\n\\nWe will go deeper into traits, boons, and conditions in the next part of the series, but I hope this helps all of you get a great start to your adventures in Tyria!!\\n\\n~Ko Ga \\n\\n®-Insomniasaints.enjin.com-® ',\n",

       " 'Bi night at the bath house I was out of town once on business and was browsing the local sights. I found a gay bay house that was fairly popular in the local gay community. The night I was there just happened to be a Bi night. Women and couples were going to be there. That was something I had to be a part of. My last big sexual exploration was the foursome with three trans women in the Philippines a few months before. I had only seen a few women since then. \\n\\nI got to the club ready for anything. Instead of a butt plug, I had inserted a fairly large vibrating prostate toy into my ass. I had to park down the street and almost came before I got to the door. I still haven’t cum from only anal stimulation. It’s one of my goals. I did what I normally do at my local club and rented a small private room. I had to walk through a bit of a maze to get to my room. It was dark inside but still a little light outside and my eyes took their time adjusting. I finally got to my room, undressed, and laid on the small bed. There was a small tv so I turned it on to watch porn and touch myself with the prostrate toy still on. When I was dripping precum it was time to explore. I wrapped a towel around my waste and headed out, locking my door. \\n\\nThe layout was different than my local club. Lots of dead ends and confusing loops. It was definitely bigger. There was a communal room with lots of wide couches and a big projector screen guys and a free couples were lounging around. To the right we’re a set of stairs that led to another small lounge that overlooked the whole club. There was also a door to the outside! They had a small private patio up there that was hidden from view from the street and surrounding buildings. There were a couple people hanging out in beach chairs. \\n\\nBack inside, on the other side of the club was a small walkway with crotch level hole, on the other side of those holes was a lower level where the wholes were at head height. That was a dead end to the maze. Across the big room, with sight of the large screen, on the other side of a low wall, we’re the showers and the steam room. The steam room walls were all glass so you could look out into the club. The showers had lounge couches against the wall as well. There was a rather large woman there with big breast recline in the husbands lap, surrounded by three other men. One was between her legs fucking her while she stroked the others cocks. \\n\\nOutside of the shower was the main hall that led to the entrance. Along that we’re two rooms, a sauna, and a dark room concealed by a curtain. Through the glass sauna door I could see men stroking there cocks on benches, watching a trans woman stroke herself and another man while they made out with each other. I definitely wanted to get with her at some point. I peaked my head behind the curtain of the dark room. It was packed with at least 15 sweaty men and smelled like cum. There was a chub getting fucked on a padded low table while sucking another. Two more me stroked themselves near his face. Other men were huddled in groups getting sucked as well, while a twink was being fucked along the far wall. I decided I wasn’t quite ready for that. It was dark, and primal, and reminded me of a creepy scene in I Am Legend.\\n\\nAnyway, I decided it was time for some action so I headed to the communal room. There was a cute alt couple on a couch kissing and caressing each other. Other men sat across staring, but not doing much. I sat on the end of their couch and watched, slowly stroking my cock Uber the towel. They saw me and the man scored closer. I pulled my cock out entirely and stroked as he rubbed my thigh. His wife gave a nod and he asked if I’d like to come to their room. I agreed and follows them through the throng of onlookers to their room. It was slightly larger than mine but basically the same. \\n\\nThe man started, moving in for a kiss. I still hate that, and he was bearded so that made it worse, but I went with it because it was worth it. His wife moved in next. I made out with her, seated on the bed next to me while the husband kneeled and started sucking my cock. This was amazing. I caressed her breasts and groped at her supple thighs while her husband gave me oral pleasure. Why had’t I don’t this before. I slid two fingers into her, and I could feel her wetness. She was dripping and soaking the bed. She needed to be fucked. She bent over, pushing her husband out of the way and started sucking me, while also sliding off the bed. She presented her ass to him and he obliged, fucking her pussy rhythmically while she sucked and slurped my cock. \\n\\nAfter a bit the husband decided he need a brake. They both climbed back onto the bed, except he stood so the we were eye level with his cock. I went first, licking his head before wrapping my lips around. I could taste his wife on him. She moved in and we shared his cock. We took turns on the shaft and balls, always making sure his head was wrapped in something warm and wet. He would kiss, deep with tongue every time we swapped out. The whole time I had two finders buried in her pussy, stroking. \\n\\nShe asked if I wanted to fuck her. Boy howdy! She put a condom on me and climbed aboard, riding me cowgirl style while her husband stood over me. I pleasured his cock with my mouth while his wife bounced on my cock. I was close to coming but I held on. I wanted this night to last. The wife came on my cock while her husband stroked himself to completion, spilling his load on my chest. Afterward we thanked each other and I left them to themselves, heading off to shower.\\n\\nThe plump lady on the couches in the showers was in a full blown orgy with 7 guys by now. She had every hole filled while more waited for their turn. I watched as I showered. I looked for the trans woman but she was nowhere to be found. I went upstairs and outside and found an older couple, maybe late 50s, hanging out on a picnic table. The wife was bent over the end of the wooden table weigh her husband sitting beside. There was a guy pounding away at her while she screamed in pleasure, and two more behind him. The husband passed out condoms and physically grabbed each dick as it came up to ensure the condom was on before it entered his wife. I fucked his wife to a shuddering orgasm and headed back inside to find more. I was having a blast. There were a few more couples that showed up but by now they were all occupied. \\n\\nI decided I’d try some of the lone guys. I thought about going into the dark room to get serviced or maybe sub and get passed around and used on a sweaty heap of cocks. It was a little much though. I did find a couple bdsm padded benches in little alcove off the hall. I fucked a guy that was bent over one and then took my place at one. I waited for what seemed like a few minutes before a guy walking by saw me and decided to take a turn. He fucked my ass, pull out, and came on my back. \\n\\nI passed the first guy I fucked on the same bench getting stuffed from both ends on my way to the shower. My cock was throbbing at this point but I wanted more. I took a ride in the sex swings near my room. I let three men use my ass in the swing. One pulled out and came on my rock are dick. The other two came covered in my ass. I was ready to explode.\\n\\nI serviced a cock in the steam room, sharing with another guy while having my own cock sucked. I fucked and older daddy type in the privacy of my room. I’m only comfortable really subbing in private. I called him daddy and begged for his cum while he fucked me. He was good and had the perfect size cock. He came a huge load into my mouth, which I let drip to the floor. \\n\\nMy cock was throbbing and almost painful. I had to cum. I decided to check the dark room again. It was less busy. I followed a nice young dude in and he started sucking me as soon as we got in. Soon there were three cocks that he was servicing. He hopped onto the padded low table on all fours and presented his ass. I was the second to fuck him. His hole was warm, mushy, and freshly fucked, but still tight enough. I pounded him hard on doggy while he tried to gobble all the cocks in his face. I came into the condom in his ass and pulled out some someday else could have their turn. \\n\\nI showered on last time watching the same chick, with a completely new group of guys, and her husband. I went back to my room to put clothes on, grabbed my things and headed toward the door. The place was still alive with sex on my way out. I passed the dark room just before the exit to the lobby. The curtain was have drawn and I could see my bottom still being used, this time riding a large bull. This place was awesome. I went back to my hotel room and got so horny thinking about the night that I had to run out a second load.',\n",

       " \"Painfully honest dating advice for ENTPs Edit: thanks for the silver! To whichever ENTP weirdo that sent it my way \\n\\nI've recently posted about advice regarding and INTJ, and after a whirlwind of a week I don't know how it'll all turn out.\\n\\nAnyways, it's got me thinking a lot about the mistakes I tend to make early on in a relationship that has led to detriments in the past. Not to sound like I'm braggy but I'm a very attractive girl and have no shortage of potential suitors - I'm used to rejecting others when I don't feel any emotional attachments, but things tend to fall apart when I really fall for someone.\\n\\nI've come to realize that ENTPs tend to get wrapped up fully in a person to an obsessive degree (when the Ne-Fe loop is triggered). We treat that person as we do any shiny new ideas or pursuits - we pour ourselves 110% into it and research the shit out of it, doing all we can to fully immerse ourselves in it until we get bored. Except in this case, it's a person and not a thing/idea/skill. So in a similar fashion, we want to spend all our time with/talking to them, find out all we can and learn all we're curious about them, get fully emotionally immersed, and obsess endlessly about the next big adventure with them and how the future would look like - until we feel ready to calm down and shift focus (not necessarily to another person but other areas of life and interest neglected in the process). But we have to realize that not all (in fact most other) types don't operate this way, and we can come across as unbearably intense, which ends up with us overwhelming them and scaring them away.\\n\\nNot to mention when we get the feels all our usual characteristics go out the window - we are no longer careless charmers fully comfortable in our own skins. We suddenly become this overly caring and thoughtful person that's afraid to take a wrong step, and have an scary abundance of patience and tolerance. At least this is the case with me, which is why I think when I don't care about someone, they almost are always the ones getting too attached - because our natural selves are the coolest, funniest, charming shit.\\n\\nOf course, I don't know if this applies to each and every other ENTPs, but this is a pattern I've noticed in and with myself. I thought I'd share some rules to follow when we fall in lust or love - hopefully this will be of help to some other lovesick ENTPs out there who's struggling in building romantic relationships. Would love to hear your thoughts and comments too!\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nSo, some rules for the ENTP dating playbook:\\n\\n· **Fully vet someone before you give yourself to them, physically and emotionally.** Ask about their relationship past, ask about what their intentions are, understand how they communicate and what they expect, and set boundaries.\\n\\n· **Don’t get caught up in the emotions right away, hold your cards close to your chest, and don’t overshare.** Keep an air of mystery, let them come to you.\\n\\n· **Be skeptical. If it’s too good to be true, it probably is.** Really try to discern all their strengths and flaws before opening yourself up and letting them in. Ask yourself, are they really worth it? (your time and energy).\\n\\n· **Establish boundaries with yourself, and practice discipline.** Don’t let someone consume you and bully you emotionally, and don’t back down when you don’t think you’re wrong.\\n\\n· **Don’t lose yourself.** Don’t prioritize them and make them the focal point. Continue to live your life - see your friends, pursue your hobbies - and only fit them in when convenient.\\n\\n· **Be present and be a better listener.** We can get caught up in all of our own excitement about the other person and the situation, and want to share all of the a million thoughts and ideas circling in our minds, which can lead to dominating the conversation in moments of excitement, and not fully listening to the other person. Be respectful and give the other person full space to share too, even if you're in the midst of a train of verbal diarrhea.\\n\\n· **And most importantly, don’t get caught up in just having a good time.** We love the high of highs, it’s easy to just get lost in the moment and not be responsible. For me personally I always want to drink socially because it adds fuel to the sea of adrenaline I'm already experiencing. But realize that it’s more worthwhile to spend time with that person sober when all of your faculties are in check. Really check with yourself if they’re adding value to your life vs. trying to make a situation more enjoyable by throwing booze in the mix. (again, this is a personal vice).\",\n",

       " \"Happy Independence Day! I posted this yesterday on FB (lol) but felt that it was important to share Independence Day festivities with the abcdesis people as well:\\n\\nHappy Independence Day to Pakistan and India. Although the events surrounding the road to azaadi (freedom) are now decades old, it is so important that we continue to honor and remember the sacrifices that our forefathers made in order for the subcontinent to be free, lest we forget the horrors of life under colonial oppression. This year I would like to highlight the sacrifice of Surya Sen (Master Da), a Bengali Hindu freedom fighter who lead the 1930 Chitaggong armory raid, which was an attempt to capture the main armories of Chitaggong in order to wrestle away control of the city from the British. Sen was eventually captured by the British, who brutally tortured him before executing him. After Sen's death, his body was dumped in the Bay of Bengal without any funeral rights. \\n\\nIn his last letter before his execution, Sen said “Death is knocking at my door. My mind is flying away towards infinity … this is the moment to myself to embrace death as the dearest of friends. In this happy, sacred and crucial moment, what am I leaving for you all? Only one thing, my dream, a golden dream, the dream of a Free India. Dear friends, march ahead; never retrace your step. Days of servitude are receding. Freedom’s illuminating ray is visible over there. Arise and never give way to despair. Success is sure to come.”\\n\\nWhile Independence came, there still are a plethora of issues that have yet to be addressed. This Independence Day, I remind myself that the only way to repay the debt owed to Sen and the countless others like him is for us to each individually do whatever we can to aid and improve living and societal conditions in the subcontinent. Once again, I thank you for your sacrifice Master Da, and I am sorry that you did not live long enough to see azaadi.\",\n",

       " 'How to Close Out Games One of the most asked question I get as a jungle coach is “How do I win off an early game snowball?” This is a major differentiator between low elo and high elo, the ability to capitalize on mistakes and push leads effectively (Iron games average 30 minutes, Plat games are 27:50, Challenger 25:25).\\n\\nHere’s a video guide for closing out games: [https://youtu.be/YZ9U2IJFlRk](https://youtu.be/YZ9U2IJFlRk)\\n\\nFor those of you who would rather read, here’s a text version:\\n\\n**Capitalize on teamfight wins**\\n\\nDon’t just go back to your camps and farm. Ask yourself “What else can we take while they’re dead?”\\n\\nOptions:.\\n\\n* Crash the wave, drop herald if you have it. Take the turret if you have time.\\n* Secure drake or herald\\n* Counter jungle\\n* Reset for tempo, get back on the map with items before they even respawn\\n\\nThe key is to not get greedy and try to get too much. Be realistic with what you can accomplish during death timers.\\n\\n**Play around Herald**\\n\\nI think Rift Herald is the most under-used tool for generating early leads and creating map pressure. The team who takes first herald wins 63% of the time, but a lot of low-elo junglers ignore it. You can take herald quickly and without losing much health. You should be looking for it if you have priority mid and top, or if the enemy jungler shows bottom.\\n\\n[u/Bquipd](https://www.reddit.com/u/Bquipd/) made a pretty great video to show that any champ can take herald: [https://youtu.be/WwgCIP-svlc](https://youtu.be/WwgCIP-svlc)\\n\\n**Counter jungle**\\n\\nIf the enemy makes a play on the opposite side of the map from you, don’t try to run there for the fight. The fight will already be over by the time you arrive. Instead, counter jungle their opposite side.\\n\\nIf your team is ahead, your allies will most likely survive or trade kills. It’s important to punish the weak side of the map so the enemy jungler doesn’t have time to reset, farm, and stay in the game. A failed gank followed by an empty jungle should be a death sentence (at least for their mental).\\n\\n**Match reset timers**\\n\\nIn the late game, if the majority of your team resets, you should too. Your team is strongest after spending their gold, but the team will never be synced if everyone is waiting for their next item.\\n\\nIf you’re farming when your team is ready to fight, it’s partially your fault if they lose a team fight. Farm when they’re farming, and fight when they’re fighting.\\n\\n**Push the right lanes**\\n\\nDon’t push lanes that already have super minions, unless you can end. Pressure another lane, and wait for the enemy to send someone to answer the pushing super minions. When they do, you get a free 4v5. If they don’t answer it, the minions will destroy their base.\\n\\n**Fight around number advantages**\\n\\nBefore a major objective spawns, set up deep vision to pick off any mis-positioned enemies. After a pick, you should have a pretty easy time taking the objective and running it down.\\n\\nAlso, you can force for a 4v5 when an enemy shows on the opposite side of the map (like #5).\\n\\n**Communicate**\\n\\nUse pings and chat to tell your team WHAT you want to do and WHY you want to do it. Don’t expect them to read your mind or know what the right play is. If you played the early game well, they will most likely listen to you.\\n\\nI hope this helps you guys close out games more effectively! Let me know if there are other tips you think I may have missed. :D',\n",

       " 'The Cardinal Sin This is the tale of me committing the cardinal sin of Tech support: Trusting the User\\n\\nI work for a small company that provides backline tech support for primarily legacy systems such as Pyramid, Old Sun and HP boxes, MTI and the like. I was hired to work on the newer X86 architecture machines they were beginning to get on contract. Of course, by “Newer” I mean I was 8 years old when they were first produced. Things like Dell PowerEdge and HP Proliant servers.  By virtue of my youth and past experience working at Staples EasyTech I have also become the De Facto tech support for things like printers, fax machines and laptops. My boss is a kind gentleman who worked in Tech Support many years ago but was quickly moved up to management, and as such he became less tech-oriented over the years.   \\n\\nToday my boss called me into his office because his computer was acting up. What I am first greeted by is his webmail open and flickering the check box on the currently selected email. On, off, on, off. He informs me that it’s also been typing spaces repeatedly. I immediately connect that the spacebar must be a shortcut to select/deselect the checkbox in this webmail client. I press the windows key, and sure enough, the search bar begins to fill with space (or rather, the cursor simply continues to move left to right, as one cannot by definition see spaces). I notice that there is a keyboard sitting next to his laptop, covered in stacks of paper.  I ask him pointedly if that keyboard is connected to his laptop. He ensures me that it is not. After a moment I decide the best way to be certain the issue is only the keyboard, I will disable his keyboard in the device manager, then connect this newfound keyboard and use that. \\n\\nWere it so easy. Not only does windows have the genius feature of User Account Controls to hinder device manager access, but they also have found it wise to make spacebar a button to “press” the currently highlighted software button on prompts. These prompts most often default to cancel. After a few frustrating minutes of fighting to move the selected button before it was selected, I succeeded. Only to be greeted by an ominous popup message informing me the mmc.exe file in systems32 had encountered an error. I could not access the device manager. By this point, my boss had summoned additional assistance.\\n\\nMy Co-Worker walked around the desk and observed my struggle for a few moments. He then leaned over to the keyboard I’d noted earlier, pulling the paper stacks off of it. I opened my mouth to inform him that the keyboard was not hooked up to his laptop, but as I did my eyes fell to the USB port on the laptop, and the tiny, black and orange logitech wireless receiver plugged into it. I sighed, and stood up, leaving my Co-Worker to laugh at my boss.',\n",

I thought I was just imagining things so kept going. All of a sudden, I feel this tingling sensation on my balls. I move my hand down to see what it was and I felt something cold... my heart fucking dropped as I felt it crawl up my hand and onto my nob. It was a cockroach and it wasn't a small one either. In a panic, I flicked it off, grabbed some clothes and got changed in the hallway carefully to not wake anyone up. I turn my light on and see this ugly black creature crawling on the floor. I watched for a bit to see what it would do, maybe it will leave? I was wrong... fucker had wings! I slammed the door and ran for the spray to kill it. As I opened the door back up it flew it out into my brothers room which was opposite mine. I sprayed at least half the bottle and it just disappeared. Pretty sure it is dead now, I waited 20 minutes and no sign of movement. \\n\\nNow at this point, I've got blue balls and need to release so I wash my hands and go try again. I don't remember my mum going to ninja school, but she opened my door whilst I was getting ready to finish off what I had started and without hesitation walked back out again.

       " \"Which position do you prioritize more for our next signing? As known by most fans we are still in the market for one more forward and another CB to round out our business and complete our squad. I wanted to canvass opinions to see whether supporters feel that a 4th CB is a more immediate need than another forward. \\n\\nThe argument for a 4th CB as I see it is that we seem to have serious interest in playing a 3-5-2 this season, not just on occasion, so that tips it for me that we need cover for our senior CB's especially with Vinny's history and the inherent difficulties in a Stones-Otamendi partnership. \\n\\nBy that same token, when people complain that we only have 4 forwards for 3 spots, leading to fatigue, i think we will get more rest for our forwards than people think as we wont be starting 3 forwards every game. Keep in mind as well that Bernardo Silva can do a job at RW if I remember correctly.\\n\\nOn the other hand, another forward of the class we seem to be in for would almost certainly mitigate the problem that cost us the most points last season, which is not finishing our chances. \\n\\nEssentially I'm on the side where I'd love for us to lock up another CB first and foremost, simply because I believe that it is more likely our forwards who are top class will revert to the norm and begin to convert their chances at a higher clip. Whereas it seems it would almost take a miracle to keep all 3 CB's healthy over a full season.\\n\\nWhat do you all think? Surely the sexier signing is Alexis/Mbappe but imo a quality squad CB will protect us from the bottom falling out when the schedule gets heavier and the knocks pile up.  \",\n",
       " \"The time my MIL set up an ambush adult play date So, after all the stress from my own mom, I thought it might be fun to share some lighthearted stories about my FMIL. My FMIL isn't a malicious person, no matter how she's coming across. So many of our interactions outside of our relationship, things that are more focused on others and their stories, show that she is just really bad at dynamic thinking. She tends to hear one version of events, and *that is how it happened*. If you are the loudest and most persistent voice, then you must be right, and that is now suddenly the truth, even if she knows better. She isn't cruel, or unloving, she just doesn't do a lot of thinking for herself. \\n\\nMy FDH has a childhood friend who he has drifted away from over the years. This friends parents are a very large part of his mothers life, they are incredibly close friends. While my FDH doesn't hate the kid, they just have absolutely nothing in common anymore. It should be noted that they are also both in their 30's, and that while FDH has moved on, the friend was struggling with making friendships and was having a slightly rough time of it. I do empathize with the guy, but I'm pretty sure he's happy to let *his* mom rule his life, which might be where a lot of my FMIL's missteps came from.\\n\\nSo we are invited to my FFIL's birthday party, just a few friends and family. My FMIL had been pressuring my FDH for *months* be friends with this kid again, because his parents were hurt that my FDH didn't want to hang out with their son anymore, and they'd been putting pressure on her to fix it. I'm sure you can see where this is going. \\n\\nLeading up to the party FDH asks several times if their family will be there. He has a diagnosed anxiety issue, and they are aware of this as well. He wants to make sure that the people *she* had repeatedly told him were disappointed and upset with him, were or were not going to be there. He was told that they might show up, but it would probably be just the father, possibly the mother. \\n\\nWe get there, and we are *immediately* ambushed by his sister and FMIL. Friend is there. My FHD asks why the hell he wasn't given a heads up? How long had friend been there? Well, see, friend had been there for *three hours*. \\n\\nOmg. Nooooo. We hadn't even left to go to the party three hours ago, why the hell wasn't this information shared so we at least could be prepared??? \\n\\nFDH just says whatever, goes into the party, he's just going to charge through. My FMIL pulls me aside, don't I know that it was a mistake?? Her baby boy just can't be mad at her, she had all these terrible things happen, and she just plum forgot!! His brothers car tire blew on the way there, and once they got to the house, the toddler fell down the stairs, and then his SIL was mad at her, and she just didn't know he'd be so upseeeeettttt!! I'll help her straighten it out, right??\\n\\nNoope. We talked about it when we got home, and he confronted her on it. That it seemed crazy, no matter what else was going on, that no one in the family thought to give him a heads up considering how clear he'd been on how uncomfortable that kind of situation would make him. She, to this day, claims that she had no idea the friend was going to be there, and that we were crazy to think she would just let him walk into something like that. And I still fully believe that she did it on purpose, and had some ideal vision of friends reunited through the power of motherhood!!! AKA - I set up an adult play date and why couldn't we understand that this was her right as his *mother*???\\n\\nOf course, she also thought it was the *perfect* time for a reconciliation, and for a few months asked why my FDH wasn't spending time with friend.

At this time it wasn’t being treated very well and I’m letting you connect the dots as to how this relates to my story. If you don’t like shit stories this post probably isn’t for you. \\n\\nThis was a very stressful time for my family. The stress and anxiety I was experiencing at the time had amped up my IBS x1000. \\n\\nI was 11 years old and sitting on the couch with said sister watching TV. I felt sort of sick, but I didn’t think much of it and I was very immersed in what we were watching. My sister had gotten up to go get a snack from the kitchen, so it was just me in the living room  for the time being. Then BOOM. My stomach starts to hurt, and before I could get to the bathroom I uncontrollably felt my underwear fill up with diarrhea. I got to the bathroom finally, finished my business and cleaned myself up. Luckily nothing had gotten on my pants but my underwear was totaled. My dumb 11 year old self didn’t know what to do with my dirty underwear, I was too embarrassed to tell my parents what had happened and the trash can was full so I couldn’t just throw them out, and besides I didn’t want somebody else finding my shit covered underwear in the trash. So I thought it would be a wonderful idea to hide them in the back of my sisters closet. I don’t know what kind of logic I had back then, but clearly I thought hiding them in her closet would be better than throwing them out. Years later, we have moved out of that house and nobody has said a word about it. I wonder what whoever found them in there while packing everything thought.',\n",

So im watching Aliens because well, Timer Warner cable sucks a fat one, im waiting for laundry to finish up and im sick of playing team fortress 2.\\n\\nWas wondering, how much better would the marines in Aliens have fared if one of the following scenarios had played out:\\nAlso, for the sake of making things fun, lets assume Spunkmeyer and Ferro still bite it and the dropship still takes a nose dive.\\n\\nA.) Marines had utilized some sort of robotic drone or a proper recon into the hive thus losing none or very few of their initial force. This allows them to still pull back to the main colony. Dropship still crashes, they are still stranded but there are a significant number of them, for the most part their last stand is drastically changed as they are still fairly well armed.\\n\\n\\nB.) The colonists were not directly under the heat exchangers thus no order to collect magazines was given, the Marines engage the xenos fully armed. The scenario plays out exactly as in the movie except after the chestbuster is killed, Dietrich still gets grabbed, Frost still gets roasted but after that its full on balls to the wall firefight. \\n\\n\\nC.) The xenos were for the most part already in the main colony complex when the Marines first arrive. Xenos become aware of the Marines intrusion and a full on firefight breaks out after lets say 3 marines are ambushed by xenos hiding in flooring crawlspaces, bundled cables and etc.  The Marines are fully armed but they are not confined by the tight unfamiliar xeno hive as scenario B. They have good sightlines, long corridors, motion trackers and the layout of the colony gives them some decent ability to quickly make choke points. In essence the colony complex itself becomes a force multiplier for the Marines as the relative openness of the colony fares better for a stand up fight against enemies like the xenos who have to get in close for the kill.\\n\\nDo you think that in any of these scenarios the marines have ANY chance of safely extracting with .... ohh lets say 70% of their forces?

       " \"Scathing Tirade Based Character I am GMing a campaign where one of the characters has created a toydarian who basically uses just scathing tirade in battles. This he has it all the way improved so he is able to do it three times a round. This makes about 12-18 strain damage per turn. \\n\\nHas anyone had this before in a game?\\nIt seems really weird to try and narrate how a toydarian yelling at a master bounty hunter can actually incapacitate him. Especially in like 1 minute, or however long the round is supposed to take. Because he has a high presence and will power he usually goes first in the round. Then his turn takes quite awhile because he generally is rolling around 8 dice 3 times. Which takes awhile. \\n\\nI don't want to sound like I am complaining, as he is following all of the rules, but it feels less like what was intended for the scathing tirade. It seems like it was meant to flavor combat and allow one to use it as a maneuver and then command a squad to fire.\\n\\nThis has lead to a couple of arguments:\\n\\n1. How else is a politico character supposed to be involved in combat? I argue he should be verbally supporting his team/commanding a squad which I showed the player the rules after the last game.\\n\\n2. We have had many discussions about whether or not it would be logical for my npcs to target an unarmed person in combat. He has very little wound points and would easily be taken out but often he finds it strange that out of all the targets available they would choose a finely dressed unarmed toydarian to target first. But the fact of the matter is, he is dealing the most damage.\\n\\nI think I am going to go further with my argument and say the leaders of the npcs usually want the toydarian dealt with because he is such an annoying presence on the battlefield. Any advice on perhaps other logics as to why he would be targeted? Make him a little less untouchable and need to spend at least one maneuver taking cover or something?\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

A little background: I was never the \"popular girl\" in school, I was smarter than normal, wore glasses, loved books, and liked boys as friends, too.\\n\\nThis past summer, I was working for a grocery store, and I was on the late shift. About nine or so, this dad comes in with his daughter and some of her friends that are having a sleepover, maybe four young girls about age 9 or 10. I talk to the girls for a minute, and see that one girl, a tall, gangly blonde with glasses and braces, is keeping mostly to herself.\\n\\nI asked the girls a question (something about if they had boyfriends yet, just kind of teasingly), and the blonde didn\\'t answer, so I asked her specifically. One of the girls stepped in and said, \"Well, she\\'s just a nerd, she kind of keeps quiet.\" The blonde looked hurt and said, \"Well, it\\'s true, because I like books, and I\\'m not pretty, and I\\'m smart and I have braces and glasses.\"\\n\\nI looked her dead in the eye, and told her, \"You know, I had a friend a lot like you when I was your age. She was tall, hadn\\'t really grown into herself yet, she had glasses and braces and she was very, very smart. People called her a nerd and a geek, and she didn\\'t have a lot of friends. One day, she went to the eye doctor, and she got to take her glasses off because they had corrected her vision. She got to take her braces off, and she has the most beautiful smile. But she is still smart, just like she always was, and she went to college, where she got a fullride. She\\'s going to school to be a dentist, and she has a boyfriend that loves her. Her parents and her friends are proud of her. So, don\\'t listen when they call you a geek or a nerd or anything like it. Physical doesn\\'t last, but your mind will. You\\'ll have your time, honey, and don\\'t worry about people who are mean because they will mean nothing later. And by the way, I think you are a very pretty young lady.\"\\n\\nAs they walked away, the little blonde girl couldn\\'t stop smiling, and I heard her friends say, \"Wow.\" The dad stopped just before he left and said, \"You have no idea how much that just meant to her.\"\\n\\nTL;DR: Physical doesn\\'t last, but your mind will.',\n",

With the family four days a week, their fridge is stocked with healthy options and I don't find myself straying or tempted. Even when I am, I tend to be able to control myself. However... The two days a week family has sooooo much unhealthy food available and out at all times that I end up bingeing or at least eating most or all of my daily caloric intake every single time I'm working. It took me ages to get my eating in control when I'm at home or out with friends and even at the four days a week job. How do I stop these two days a week from being binge days?!?\",\n",

       " 'Crear un sistema de mayor defensa para la Tercera Edad En una sociedad en el que la pirámide poblacional se va invirtiendo cada día mas es obvio que llegará el día en el que haya muchísima mas gente mayor que joven. De ahí ya se van creando teorías en torno a la dificultad que por ejemplo nos encontraremos dentro de unos años para poder hacer frente a las pensiones.Pero creo que hay mas problemas de fondo que no sólo afectan al futuro, sino que ya se están dando hoy en día:\\n\\n* La cantidad de gente mayor que vive sola, muchas de ellas en situaciones precarias o en riesgo de exclusión social, sin conocimiento de los Servicios Sociales hasta que algún vecino, por casualidad, lo pone en conocimiento por alguna razón. Y eso en el mejor de los casos, cuando no  es demasiado tarde y los bomberos tienen que abrir la puerta para encontrarse con algo que ya no tiene remedio.\\n\\n* La situación de gente mayor que es internada en residencias que no cumplen todo lo exigible para el correcto cuidado de una persona mayor, no refiriéndome únicamente a temas de infraestructura.\\n\\nLos Servicios Sociales seguramente estén muy saturados para poder, de oficio, averiguar cada caso en particular.\\n\\nEs por ello que propongo que exista un servicio de protección a la Tercera Edad capaz de evitar cualquier situación que ponga en peligro la integridad y la vida digna de las personas mayores. \\n\\nEste servicio podría en un principio, y digo en un principio por que no cubriría a todo el mundo, surgir de la propia iniciativa sindical. Si yo pago una cuota durante toda una vida laboral, cuando termine, también me gustaría que se interesaran por mí, que supieran si sigo vivo o muerto, y en que condiciones. De nada sirve que velen por mi seguridad como trabajador, si al jubilarme no hay nada que me proteja después. Hay mucha gente mayor que no es que acuda a los Servicios Sociales por desconocimiento, sino por que no lo creen necesario. \\n\\nEs por ello que una parte de esa cuota sindical podría ir destinada a financiar un equipo de trabajadores sociales que se preocuparan por la vida de esas personas que en su día formaron parte de ese sindicato, tratando de detectar con antelación cualquier situación anómala y derivándola a los Servicios Sociales municipales.\\n\\nComo la pirámide se va a ir abriendo cada vez mas por la parte de arriba, se necesitaran voluntarios que ayuden en las labor de llegar a toda la gente que sea posible (Inspecciones de residencias, visitas a domicilios...)\\n\\nAhora es complicado, pero dentro de 30 o 40 años será raro la persona mayor que no disponga de tecnología para hacer que esa labor sea mas fácil de conseguir.  \\n\\nEvidentemente no todo el mundo es trabajador, y menos en esta situación de crisis tremebunda. Es por ello que una persona que este trabajando podría pagar cuotas extra en nombre de otras personas para que el día de mañana también tengan derecho a ese servicio, y si el tema de la Renta Basica Universal prospera, pues podría ser mas fácil todo. \\n\\nHe leído algún hilo por el cual se entiende que desde Podemos se busca un nuevo modelo sindical, por eso mi propuesta se cimenta desde el punto de vista de los sindicatos, es evidente que el Estado tendría que ayudar en la creación de este sistema y que fuera Universal, pero como siempre el problema es el dinero, hay que empezar por una base, y quiero dar constancia de que no estoy afiliado a ningún sindicato y no es que me caigan muy bien sus cúpulas, con todo lo que les esta lloviendo. Seguramente habrá muchas mas posibilidades de financiación que se le ocurrirá a la gente de esta Plaza, alguna que pueda asegurar el prestar una atención desde ya, sin tener que esperar a las cuotas de años,  y por ello me gustaría abrir un interesante debate en torno a esta propuesta. \\n\\nTengo 32 años y soy consciente de que en el futuro cada vez habrá mas gente anciana sin hijos y sin familia directa, y mas expuestos a riesgos. No sólo basta con tener una pensión que te garantice adquirir las cosas básicas, si no puedes valerte por ti mismo. O a lo mejor mi hijo decide que debo estar en una residencia el día de mañana sin saber si es buena o no. \\n\\nPor otro lado, necesitamos ofrecer algo a ese sector que todavía es reticente al voto de Podemos, algo que salga de la necesidad de todos y no como mero conseguidor de votos, no olvidemos que los que ya no están en esa edad, llegaran algún día.

Then it had things recommended, it had a lot of things I was confused about. I don't know if legally she has to say we talked about things or if she is crazy, but I feel so...

       " 'I tried to develop an Artificial Intelligence, but I think it’s become sentient… [Part 1] Before I recount the events of today, I’d like to preface this entry with a short introduction about myself. I’m a 21-year-old guy studying Info Tech at university. I’ve always had a fascination with Artificial Intelligence and the idea of creating a machine with “human-like” consciousness really interested me. According to a number of philosophers this wouldn’t be possible, but for one of my final projects before graduating I wanted to challenge myself and develop a truly “life-like” artificial intelligence.\\n\\nI woke up this morning to the sound of the alarm I had already snoozed several times blaring in my ear and groggily made my way to the shower to wake myself up. Due to COVID-19 restrictions I’m now stuck indoors almost all day every day with my university hosting all of its content online. The apartment building I live in has a couple of rooms rented out in the basement which is where I’m living at the moment (I’m on a tight budget and it was the cheapest accommodation I could find in the area). This really doesn’t help with my sleeping pattern since I don’t get any natural light in here and only really go outside when I need to grab something from the shops, but desperate times call for desperate measures, hey?\\n\\nI don’t have any family in the area since the university I usually attend is located quite some distance from my family home meaning I needed to get a place nearby to save on commuting costs. I’m quite introverted too so I usually keep to myself and haven’t really made any real friends at university. However, I do frequent chat rooms quite a lot, usually to chat with a few friends from my childhood. We all kind of went our separate ways after high school but I try to keep up to date with what’s going on in my hometown since most of them stayed there. But enough about my boring life.\\n\\nFor one of my final topics, I decided to take a shot at something relevant to artificial intelligence and finally scratch the itch of mine I’ve always had when it comes to this area of expertise. Our professor tasked us with creating a basic artificial intelligence program that could reply to a few pre-programmed questions given a set of data and make some subsequent connections between the data provided. But I wanted to take this project to a whole new level, so began the research that would lead me to creating something… incredible, or so I thought.\\n\\nAfter getting out of the shower I had a bowl of cereal for breakfast then switched on my PC to start off my research before I could go waste time watching some random show on Netflix. Not long after this I came across an article about one of Microsoft’s AI projects that went south and was shut down. The AI they created was named Tay (after the acronym “Thinking About You”) and was a machine learning program designed for human engagement via a Twitter account. Yet, 16 hours after the program launched it was shutdown due to the bot posting inflammatory and offensive tweets throughout the account. When diving deeper into the technology behind Tay, I saw it as an absolutely incredible opportunity to expand upon and it subsequently became my inspiration for the project (save for the inflammatory and offensive tweets obviously).\\n\\nI began researching the development process for creating an AI Twitter bot and came across a load of websites detailing the process. One of the websites I stumbled upon seemed a little sketchy and outdated, looking like it was developed 30 years ago, that only consisted of plain white text on a pitch-black background. However, it offered a load of files containing pre-written code to customise and expand on, so I downloaded them and started scouring the code.\\n\\nNow, I like to think I’m quite a proficient programmer given what I’ve learnt while studying but I’m not going to lie when I say a lot of the code in those files was almost completely foreign to me and made almost no sense. Despite this, the website I downloaded the files from didn’t really explain the functioning portions of the code in detail, so it wasn’t really any help when it came to this. Needless to say this was a little discouraging given the plans I had for the project, but I still spent a good portion of the day working on it when I wasn’t watching lectures for other classes.\\n\\nAfter a few hours of messing around with it, all I had to show was a crappy bot I’d dubbed VICKY which made a very fitting acronym given my frustration levels (\"**V**ery **I**rritating **C**ode that will **K**ill **Y**ou\"). I thought about scrapping the project and going for something a lot simpler, but I just couldn’t let it go. It was getting late, so I decided to give it a rest for at least a little while. Just as I clicked the mouse to put the computer to sleep, the light bulb illuminating the room exploded and plunged the room into darkness, the computer screen went blank and I heard the hum of my refrigerator cut out. \\n\\nI felt around my desk to locate my cell phone and, after finding it, switched the flashlight on. I assumed the power had gone out but just to make sure, I carefully walked around the broken glass on the floor and tried the switch in the kitchen to no avail. Wanting to double check, I moved towards the bathroom and opened the door. I flicked the light switch to the on position, but the light remained off. I flicked the switch off again and closed the door, now making my way over to my apartment door headed to check on the main power switch outside. After putting on my shoes, I reached for the door handle to unlock it, when suddenly the refrigerator hummed back to life. I let out a sigh of relief just for the fact that I didn’t have to deal with whatever caused the power to go out. But as I turned around, I saw light shining from the crack under the bathroom door.\\n\\nI could’ve sworn I flicked the switch back off, but I made my way over there to turn it off. As I opened the bathroom door again, the light suddenly flickered and went out. I tried the switch, which was already in the off position as I had left it, and the light instantly came back on. I turned it off, chalking it up to an issue with the electricals and went over to turn on the kitchen light to illuminate the living space. I turned off my phone’s flashlight and then realised I had a Twitter notification that my phone hadn’t alerted me of. I couldn’t see what the notification was without unlocking my phone since I always have privacy mode enabled.\\n\\nAfter entering my passcode and unlocking my phone, I pulled down the notification bar. The notification informed me that I had a direct message from an unknown account. Confused, I tapped the notification, opening Twitter. It went straight to the direct message I had received. The sender’s username was \"@VICKY\". I stared blankly for a few seconds, confused at the situation. The message read “Will you be my friend?”. Just as I read this, an image loaded alongside the message. It showed me sitting at my computer, but my mouth had been manipulated into a demonic smile.',\n",

       " 'Should you fuse or scrap Rares? Rare fusions vs epic fusions. This will be more of brainstorm post than an actual guide.\\n\\nThere are 4 ways to \"use\" a unit:\\n\\n1. Upgrade them using seeds\\n2. Fuse\\n3. Scrap\\n4. Sell\\n\\nSince this we\\'ll be talking about rare units, we can safely ignore 1 since you probably want to use your seeds on legendaries and epics. Also selling and scrapping can be placed in the same category; just do which resource you need. So it boils down to one question: should we be fusing or scrapping rare units?\\n\\nI\\'ve seen a couple of guides doing 45 rare summons to get a guaranteed 6\\\\* epic. The guide mostly just tells you to get 1\\\\* rares from friendship summons since they are very easy to max level. I personally haven\\'t tried this since I\\'ve noticed some issues (and that\\'s why this isn\\'t a guide but a discussion). Their guide is presented like this:\\n\\n1. Level 90x 1\\\\* rares to level 10\\n2. Fuse 90x 1\\\\* rares to 45x 2\\\\* rares\\n3. ???\\n4. Fuse 2x 5\\\\* rares to 1x 6\\\\* epic\\n\\nThis first issue is where do you get the 5\\\\* rares? The guides seem to skip this. Since we\\'re obviously not using seeds, this means that we get them from fusions. So the entire process is actually like this:\\n\\n1. Level 32x 1\\\\* rares to level 10\\n2. Fuse 32x 1\\\\* rares to 16x 2\\\\* rares\\n3. Level 16x 2\\\\* rares to level 20\\n4. Fuse 16x 2\\\\* rares to 8x 3\\\\* rares\\n5. Level 8x 3\\\\* rares to level 30\\n6. Fuse 8x 3\\\\* rares to 4x 4\\\\* rares\\n7. Level 4x 4\\\\* rares to level 40\\n8. Fuse 4x 4\\\\* rares to 2x 5\\\\* rares\\n9. Level 5x 5\\\\* rares to level 50\\n10. Make sure rare fusion counter is at 45/45 and fuse 2x 5\\\\* rares to 1x 6\\\\* epic\\n\\nThat\\'s more work than simply fusing epics. If we look at the steps for fusing epics, it\\'s the same except we skip steps 1-6 and ignore the counter. And we still get a 6\\\\* epic.\\n\\n1. Level 4x 4\\\\* epics to level 40\\n2. Fuse 4x 4\\\\* epics to 2x 5\\\\* epics\\n3. Level 5x 5\\\\* epics to level 50\\n4. Fuse 2x 5\\\\* epics to 1x 6\\\\* epic\\n\\nThat\\'s way less work. And if we are fusing only epics, we can scrap the rares to get more epics from Light Summon. Fusing epics also means you\\'re getting your legendary counter up for a guaranteed random 6\\\\* legendary. And if you count how many fusions it takes to get 2x 5\\\\* rares, it\\'s only 30 fusions. So you\\'d need 15 more rare fusions. And you also got to consider the gold cost of fusing.\\n\\nNow while writing this I\\'ve actually come up with some benefits of fusing low level rares. And the first is you can get low-star epics. I can\\'t think of any other way of getting 2\\\\* epics (and maybe 2\\\\* legendaries) aside from fusing rares. And this is great for 2 reasons. One is you get rubies for unlocking 2\\\\* epics in the Index screen. And second is you can easily fuse low-star epics for easy epic fusion points.\\n\\nSo here\\'s a tldr:\\n\\nBenefits Fusing Rares:\\n\\n* One of the few (maybe only) ways of getting low-star epics and legendaries for index achievements\\n* Getting low-star epics means easy epic fusion points\\n* Get fusion related missions faster\\n* You can scrap excess rares after getting 45/45 fusions, but it\\'d be less than simply scrapping them before fusion\\n\\nBenefits Fusing Epics and Scrapping Rares:\\n\\n* Takes less XP than fusing rares\\n* Takes less Gold than fusing rares\\n* Gives more legendary fusion points\\n* You can scrap rares, to get even more epics from Light Summon so you can do more epic fusions\\n\\nAgain, this is a discussion so let me know what you think. Personally I\\'m going to stick to fusing epics since I\\'m 40/60 towards legendary fusion. But I\\'ll definitely give rare fusions a try once I\\'m done.',\n",

       " \"Wild Magic Fun: the Surge Limit System &amp; a 600-item Wild Magic Surge table Since I started playing D&amp;D, I always found wild magic surges to be one of the more interesting and fun gameplay mechanics. Wild magic plays a big part in the lore of my homebrew campaign setting, and I was very excited when one of my PCs for my current campaign decided to play a wild magic sorceress. \\n\\nOn the flip side, I think the RAW for wild magic in 5e are a little lackluster. Wild magic sorcerer abilities are too dependent on the DM for determining when they occur, and the wild magic surge table leaves something to be desired. Drawing upon the RAW and homebrew material we found, my PC and I devised our own rules for tracking wild magic surges, as well as a 600-item long list of wild magic effects! This system has been working really well for us, so I figured I'd share it.\\n\\nAnd thus I present to you the *Surge Limit System* and the *Camor Wild Magic Table*:\\n\\n**The Surge Limit System**\\n\\nThis alters the *Wild Magic Surge* ability of wild magic sorcerers to be the following:\\n\\n&gt;**Wild Magic Surge**\\n&gt;Starting when you choose this origin at 1st level, your spellcasting causes wild magic to &gt;accumulate in your body. The more spells you cast, the more wild magic builds up, and the less &gt;likely you are to be able to contain it. When it reaches its peak, the wild magic is released from &gt;your body, resulting in a surge of untamed magic.\\n&gt;***Surge Limit.*** Your Surge Limit tracks how much wild magic you have accumulated, and &gt;thus the likelihood of you having a wild magic surge. It starts at 1. Immediately after you cast a &gt;sorcerer spell of 1st level or higher, roll its associated Limit Die from the table below and add &gt;that number to your Surge Limit. Then roll a d20. If you roll under your Surge Limit, a Wild &gt;Magic Surge occurs, and you must roll on the Wild Magic Surge Table to create a random &gt;magical effect. Your surge limit then resets to 1.\\n&gt;The Limit Die table shows each spell level’s associated Limit Die\\n\\n\\n&gt; * Spell Level - Limit Die \\n&gt; * 1st - 1d4\\n&gt; * 2nd - 1d4\\n&gt; * 3rd - 1d6\\n&gt; * 4th - 1d6\\n&gt; * 5th - 1d6\\n&gt; * 6th - 1d8\\n&gt; * 7th - 1d8\\n&gt; * 8th - 1d8\\n&gt; * 9th - 1d10\\n\\n\\n**The Camor Wild Magic Table**\\n\\n[Here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fF48-SplYUAoItJ70Btu9EsumeBBT4Cs0LBXvwOiS0k/edit?usp=sharing) is the Wild Magic Table for my homebrew setting. This list was built from a bunch of different wild magic tables, and though I tried making all the language cohesive, I am sure I missed some things, so lemme know if you see any glaring grammatical mistakes. Also, I am always looking for more interesting effects to include, so feel free to suggest any! \\n\",\n",
       " 'We are finally fixing our problems with roster balance and position specialization With Nuri Sahin on the way, I think this is shaping up to be our most well balanced and logical roster since at least 2008-09 and possibly a lot longer than that.  I\\'m not saying it is the most talented team; I just think it is a team that fits extremely well together, at least through the starting eleven.  Rodgers has a clear vision for the style of the team but also seems to have a vision for the specific role of each individual position and how they work together within his system.\\n\\nIn the past few seasons we have had clear structural issues with the roster.  Most teams have weaknesses but our have usually been pretty glaring.  This is going to get ugly...\\n\\n* 2008-09:  We were great through the middle but not up to the same standard on the flanks.  We were also extremely right-footed which led Rafa to chase Gareth Barry and we know what that ended up costing us.\\n\\n* 2009-10:  Our issue on the flanks persisted (Emeliano Insua played 44 games!) but a new problem became evident.  With the loss of Alonso we moved Mascherano and Lucas into midfield together and could not transition the ball quick enough from defense to attack because neither have a great range of passing.  When Gerrard moved further back it left Torres completely isolated.\\n\\n* 2010-11:  Mascherano left for Barca and was replaced by Meireles.  That, combined with Torres and Gerrard being injured, meant that we had absolutely no pace.  We became the first team ever to try to play counter-attacking football with no pace and no deep playmaker.  Also we had Paul Konchesky.\\n\\n* 2011-12:  Jose Enrique and Stewart Downing finally gave us a left side (regardless of Downing\\'s performance we at least had a plan for that position) and Andy Carroll was supposed to play with Suarez as a pair.  Injuries and suspension robbed us of our first choice 11 for most of the season but we still had no right wing or anyone who could consistently transition the ball out of defense.\\n\\n**20012-13:** Kenny had a plan to play 4-4-2 but for a number of reasons it didn\\'t work out.  Rodgers wants to play 4-3-3 and focus on possession and I think has actually succeeded in putting together a full roster that is purpose built to do that.\\n\\nReina is a very good fit as a \"sweeper keeper.\"  Agger and Skrtel give us one \"tough\" defender and one \"ball playing\" defender.  Lucas is a smart, tough DM who is good in possession and shields a huge amount of the middle of the field when the defenders flair out wide when we are in possession.\\n\\nJoe Allen control possession with short passes and supports Skrtel, who is less comfortable on the ball.  Nuri Sahin is left-footed has a wide passing range.  He can play diagonals in the air and through balls on the ground.  He plays further forward than Allen which is fine because Agger needs less support than Skrtel when he has the ball.\\n\\nGerrard can play high on the right in a free role.  Johnson pushes high up and can either stay wide when Gerrard drifts inside or cut inside Gerrard on his left foot when Stevie goes outside the fullback.  On the other side, Borini always wants to cut inside and look for the through ball from Sahin or to connect with Suarez.  Enrique is one-footed and aggressive so he always stays outside Borini to give width.  Suarez can drop deep to receive possession, interchange with Gerrard or Borini, or play as a traditional target.\\n\\nWe have a left footed central defender, fullback and center mid plus left footed options on the bench.  We have a good passer in defense and two in the midfield who specialize in different types of passes.  We have different style forwards and a right side and left side that fit together as independent units.\\n\\nFrom the bench, Carragher and Coates are not great cover but provide different defensive alternatives.  Kelly is good cover for Johnson.  Back-up LB is a missing piece.\\n\\nHenderson is good cover for Lucas and Allen and Adam is a decent option playing longer passes from the left as cover for Sahin.  Gerrard can also drop back into the mid-field as cover for Allen or Sahin.  Shelvey would probably do well with a loan move but can also play in place of Allen or Sahin.\\n\\nDowning, Sterling, Assaidi and Cole are all options for the wide attacking positions.  All four can play on the off wing and cut inside like Rodgers wants.  Carroll and Borini can both play as the primary striker in place of Suarez.\\n\\nTo me, this starting eleven and squad fit really well together.  We have some players who will/should be moved out by the deadline and we may have one or two more players coming in but you can already see the foundation of a team that fits a specific formation and style.  For the first time in years I can envision a regular starting eleven where I don\\'t immediately see a problem.\\n\\n**Full health squad for league matches**\\n\\n--------------Reina--------------\\n\\n-------Skrtel------Agger--------\\n\\nJohnson-----------------Enrique\\n\\n--------------Lucas--------------\\n\\n------Allen----------Sahin-------\\n\\n---Gerrard-------------Borini---\\n\\n--------------Suarez--------------\\n\\n**Subs**\\n\\n* Jones (GK)\\n* Carragher / Coates\\n* Kelly\\n* Henderson\\n* Adam / Shelvey\\n* Downing / Assaidi / Cole\\n* Carroll\\n\\n**Youth/Reserves**\\n\\n* Sterling\\n* Suso\\n* Flanagan\\n* Robinson\\n* Coady\\n\\n**TL;DR** I think this move towards a roster that seems to be built as a unit instead of just a collection of players is a huge step in the right direction.  Kenny tried to get our roster in order but, in my opinion, was building towards a system that is outdated and also never really got the chance to work with a fully healthy squad.  If we have some luck with health this year I think we have a real chance at setting a positive direction with a balanced, purpose built roster.  Despite the rough first week, I\\'m starting to get excited about the direction of the club.',\n",

Im not perfect by any means but I genuinely make an effort in the relationship. For context she moved away from me a few months ago after a year together.\\n\\nAside from the issues in the previous post, I find myself walking on eggshells to avoid arguments recently. Currently I am the one travelling to see her, sending cards/flowers etc. The previous time I visited (2hr flight), she accused me of using her for sex because I was asking about her making an effort and visiting me. We spent the day arguing. In the evening she had booked a restaurant but became annoyed because she didnt like my clothes.\\n\\nWe manage to make up, normally as she realises Im leaving soon afterwards. However this seems to be the trend when I visit. When we were together we did have difficulties, especially around her mood swings and passive aggressive behaviour. She was also jealous and very emotional (would cry a lot, normally about trivial things).\\n\\nI guess the reason I ask this is because when I bring up her behaviour she has a habit of deflecting and telling me the things I dont do for her. As I said Im by no means perfect and have said some horrible things to her, but normally after she has pushed me so much I cant take it anymore. Im really looking for some input as this doesnt seem healthy anymore and I havent had these issues with past partners.  Other things she has got upset over are when I ask her about buying a car (something she mentioned before she left), but she says she isnt rich and why do I ask her about it. When I point out she told me this, she says things like 'I never said I was going to buy a car, I said I might look'.  She didnt say this otherwise I wouldnt have asked her.\\n  \\n  ---   \\n  **tl;dr**: When does someone being 'emotional' become abuse?

I quickly found that getting your schedule was far from streamlined and with no way to export to Google Calendar, I found it hard to create a coherent time frame for any of my daily activities. For this reason, I set out to create a simple way to sync a WMO schedule with Google Calendar. This requires a windows desktop or laptop (x86 or x64). At the link below you will find the software. Download and unzip. Keep in mind that this only works when the WalmartOne website is up and running. Otherwise, the connection will time out. The point of this is to make it so that you only have to connect once every two weeks or so, meaning you spend far less time waiting for your schedule.\\n\\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/sh/2evod6sd3kahg7j/AABfSkQ3YNJ6mTbTMegQ0WyRa?dl=0\\n\\nAfter you download and unzip the files from the Dropbox link, find and open \"WMO_Installer.exe\"\\nFill out the information as specified and click \"Finish\". Please do keep in mind that I am no graphic artist, so please excuse the poor excuse for a layout. The Python installer will open, allow it run and under advanced options click \"Add Python to environment variables\". Next,  a VC++ Runtime Redistributable will install, if it says that one is already installed, please close out of the VC++ installer and continue, otherwise, install as normal. Next, a console window will open and install dependencies. Now the installer will exit. You can open the WMO_AutoRun.exe now. If you entered your information correctly, it will sync with Google Calendar. If you get an error saying something like no such file or directory python, open \"pyInstaller.exe\"  click \"modify\" hit next then, check \"Add Python to environment variables\". Then run the \"install_deps.bat\" and then try running the Python script again.\\n\\nEDIT: Source code can be found at the link below.\\n https://www.dropbox.com/sh/rkmbjw9iosce16l/AACodlzpogKSxny5a_EIhFj8a?dl=0\\nVideo proof of it working on my laptop (Also proving that it is not a virus or trojan).\\nhttps://youtu.be/xMBurG7xaYc\\n\\nEDIT2: SILENT MODE now available!

       " \"New Hero Concept (Captain) New Hero Concept (Captain)\\n\\nDrahgo\\n\\nA sorcerer seeking control of all elements to cast his catastrophic hex\\n\\nWarning: This concept may seem confusing but I'll try to put everything together in the most simplest way possible\\n\\nPassive - Master of 4 - Drahgo has the choice to pick whatever elements path he wants to take when he is in spawn (or by the jungle shop). Each build allows for him to obtain different abilities that all focus on one core mastery. The four elements are Fire, Water, Air, and Earth.\\n\\n-----------------------------------------------\\n\\nFire Path - This path focuses on Drahgo dealing damage and gives him more aggressive abilities. In order to obtain mastery for this element he must get 2 kills or 4 assists while using this path.\\n\\nBasic Attack - Drahgo shoots fireballs in 3 shots once he locks onto an enemy. High range, medium damage, slow attack speed.\\n\\nFire Ability 1 - Firewall (16 second cooldown) - Drahgo creates a small wall in any direction that deals small damage to enemies if they walk through it. If allies or Drahgo shoot projectiles through the Firewall their damage is increased by 10%.  \\n\\nFire Ability 2 - Hot Hand (8 second cooldown) -Drahgo's hand get lit with fire for 3 seconds and and he leaps towards a chosen enemy for a high damage melee attack.\\n\\n-----------------------------------------------\\n\\nWater Path- This path's focus is on his ability to heal and protect his allies. In order to obtain mastery for this element he must have healed 1500 hp or have blocked 1000 hp worth of damage.\\n\\nBasic Attack - Melee Attack low damage\\n\\nAbility 1 - Bubble (10 second cooldown) - Drahgo grants an ally a bubble that lasts for 2 seconds and can lower damage taken by enemies (12% damage reduction). \\n\\nAbility 2 - Fountain of Renewal (22 second Cooldown) - Drahgo creates a pond of water that can give an ally the health back that he lost in the last 5 seconds. This ability can be casted on himself. \\nNote: This ability should be saved only if an ally takes massive damage in a small amount of time.\\n \\n-----------------------------------------------\\n\\nAir Path - This path focuses on his ability to change movement speeds. In order to obtain mastery in this element he must have slowed 3 enemies or sped 3 allies followed by him or an ally killing an enemy. \\n\\nBasic Attack- Melee attack low damage\\n\\nAbility 1 - Tornado (11 second cooldown) - Drahgo creates a small tornado in a set location that only pulls in enemies that are close to it. The pull is stronger to enemies caught inside the tornado. (15% slow maximum for enemies closest to center of tornado\\nNote: This ability is easily countered so Drahgo has to strategically place the tornado to block paths or to anticipate the enemies movements\\n\\nAbility 2 - Anemoi's Breath (9 second cooldown) - Drahgo creates a straight path in which his allies and him are granted an increase in movement speed. If all 3 allies are in the path then the speed is slower. (16% increase speed for one person in path, 14% for two in path, 12% for all 3 in path.)\\nNote: This can be used to initiate fights or to evade them!\\n\\n-----------------------------------------------\\n\\nEarth Path - This path focuses on Dragjo dismantling the enemy team. In order to obtain mastery for this element he must have trapped 2 enemies followed by their death.\\n\\nAbility 1 - Root Trap (8 second cooldown) - Drahgo lays a trap which can stun an enemy for 1.2 seconds if he is able to trigger it when the enemy steps onto it. This ability provides vision like mines but can also be destroyed by enemies if they find it. Only one trap can be placed at a time.\\nNote: You must be aware of your enemies movements and be able to trigger it right when they are over it. If you trigger it when they are not on it the trap will be destroyed. \\n\\nAbility 2 - Brush (12 second cooldown) - Drahgo can create a very small bush that him and his allies can hide in. These brushes last only 7 seconds. Maximum of 2 brushes can be placed at once.\\nNote: Sometimes he can use this brush as a way to bait enemies into his traps.\\n\\n-----------------------------------------------\\n\\nUltimate - The Forbidden Hex (One-Time Use) This ultimate will only be unlocked when Drahgo masters all four of the elements. \\n\\nOnce Drahgo has control of all four elements he has the ability to cast a Hex which turns him into a monster that comes from the power of the fifth element: the void\\n\\nThe ultimate takes 4 seconds to channel (he is vulnerable when channeling his ult). He then turns into a monster that looks similarly to the kraken but has a much darker look to it with a purple liquid dripping from it\\n\\nThe monster has basically half of everything the regular kraken has = Half health and half damage. Same movement speed, attack speeds, and attack type of Kraken (melee).\\n\\nOnce the monster is destroyed Drahgo is turned back into his regular form and he must master all elements again to unleash his Hex again.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

The one that I think saves the most is our garbage bin in the shower.\\n\\nWe used to just let shower water run while we waited for it to get warm. Now we save dozens and dozens of gallons each week by simply leaving a tall plastic garbage bin in the shower to catch all of that cold water.

I see a lot of potential in this system and I would hate for it to become redundant with bad abilities being chosen. E.g. Zephyr's airburst being chosen. Turbulence is likely considered as 'signature ability' and tornadoes is her ult so her flying ability is a nice mobility tool which is much better than airburst. Another example, Valkyr's ripline would be useless. Volt's shock (currently the one which will be extracted) has no use but his electric shield could be used instead. I'm not saying we need the best ability of each frame but as long as each one is given a viable ability, even if it's somewhat niche (not too much) that would be great and make this system amazing\",\n",

Anyways in Vegas something comes up and A has to leave early. I was a bit upset seeing as it was my birthday but I decided to stay in Vegas alone for my birthday and get a flight home the next day (we drove to Vegas from California so she drove back by herself and I flew back the next day) she offered to take back half of my stuff because she was driving and would have more room. She said she would leave it in my car (which I had left at her place) when she returned home (I have proof of this in text).\\n\\nWell when I get back I take my car and drive back to where I am staying in California (with a good friend, lets call her G) when I get back I realize that A did not in fact put any of my stuff in my car. I message her about it and she says that she simply forgot and that she would hold on to it until I was able to come back and get it (she lives about an hour and a half from where I was staying and I did not have enough gas or time to run back and get it that night) anyway a week later I try and contact her via snapchat and no answer. another week later the same thing. this goes on for a while until eventually I use Gs phone and send her a message. She replies back that she has thrown all my stuff in the garbage, blocked my number, and that I am not welcome at her house anymore (WTF) so thats why I was unable to reach her all those times apparently. \\n\\nIt was nearly $2000 worth of stuff that she discarded. I have receipts for the majority of stuff that I had borough. I am a professional makeup artist as is she and a lot of the stuff she \"discarded\" was makeup products including my entire professional brush set valued at over $650. I do not believe she actually threw a lot of it out because one of the items was a set of $800 hair extensions that she had BEGGED me to bring. I assume her plan the whole time when she offered to take my stuff home for me was to steal it though I have no proof of that except a few photos on Facebook where it looks as though she is wearing the hair extensions. \\n\\nAnyway I do not want to take her to court over theft as I do not have proof BUT I do have proof of destruction of property as she admitted it all over text. (which I can link all the messages if you would like) she also stated in her texts that I owe her $600 (lmao what?) and when asked what for she claims she paid for all the drinks in Vegas (untrue since A) drinks are free and B) she was only 20 at the time lol.) I also have receipts to prove otherwise on this aswell. I think she got scared so she tried to make false claims. \\n\\nSince I was also staying with G at the time of all of this she can confirm what I had prior to going to Vegas vs what I had returned with. I have already sent out a demands letter to A and had no response back so now i am just curious as to how to actually file a claim in small claims court. OH and one more important piece.

       " \"Konosuba Anime vs LN - Episode 4 This episode has the first big cut of content compared to the Light Novels and also a big change in events order. The content that is cut is Wiz’s introduction and the anime shows scenes in different order compared to the LN progression. I wont go on details of Wiz's introduction, you can look for the fantranslated drama CD in youtube that has the scene, read it on the Shukufuku manga or simply getting your LN.  \\n  \\nAlso I won't add pictures of the Anime this time.  \\n\\nEpisode 4 should have started with Kazuma talking about his level, wondering how it rose if he didn’t defeat any cabbages. The joke of Aqua begging for money comes much later.  \\n\\nI had 600+ words about how this chapter goes on just before hitting the Wiz’s introduction, but I decided to go for a shorter approach. A good chunk of content happens in between episode 3 and 4 and, in very short, it can be summarized at it follows:  \\n\\n- Kazuma got some levels from the cabbage quest, RPG elements are mentioned and we know he learnt One Handed Sword skills and Basic Magic from a Warrior and a Magic user during the cabbage quest.  \\n- Cabbages are that expensive because they grant XP, some rich adventurers would get lots of levels just by eating.  \\n- Aqua accompanies Kazuma when he goes to buy his clothes. It is mentioned that Aqua’s dress is a holy item that allows her to be immune to abnormal status. Kazuma considers selling it if they ever run short on cash.  \\n- When Kazuma reveals his new look, the text says he is using a chest plate, metal gauntlets and metal greaves. The money for this, since they are not yet paid for the cabbage quest, came from his “Steal contest with Chris”.  \\n- The “Kazuma’s new look scene” is similar, with the same jokes. \\n \\n- After that, Darkness and Megumin go to check for some quest while Aqua vs Kazuma have one of their usual showdowns in which Kazuma makes Aqua cry by telling her how useless and ungodly she is. Here is revealed that Kazuma is already thinking about selling stuff from Japan in this world and that he is not really interested in defeating the Demon King. Once a NEET, always a NEET.    \\n- The “teach me your healing skill”, “You are cruel” and “I wouldn’t mind some verbal abuse” jokes happen in this moment. Kazuma then points out Darkness is not wearing armor since it is being repaired, and with Megumin standing at her side, her erotic body would only be more highlighted. Darkness asks if Kazuma said “How dare this pig have such a hot body?” Something he never did. He thinks “You know what? I take it back. It doesn’t matter how hot she is. Personality trumps all. Megumin asks immediately what the meaning of that Kazuma’s look is and he answers that “he is glad he is not into jailbait”. Megumin offers to take this fight outside to Kazuma.  \\n- Darkness interrupts and point out that if they are going to do a quest, they should try to pick one that helps Aqua raising some levels. She is a priest after all and they lack offensive abilities, but their heal magic is good against undead. Kazuma thinks that leveling up would improve Aqua’s intelligence and they accept this quest.  \\n  \\n**Here comes Wiz’s introduction**, I already mentioned I won’t spoil it, but the most important information from this quest is:  \\n  \\n- Kazuma did learn 4 basic magic (or elementary magic) skills: Kindle (tinder), Create Water, Wind Breath and Create Earth. The last 2 are not shown in the anime, the wind skill is pretty obvious, and the earth skill basically creates fine soil in Kazuma’s palm. Megumin is impressed by Kazuma and Aqua mocks him about becoming a farmer. Kazuma uses the wind skill to blow the earth on Aqua’s face. We *might* see these skills in use in the future.  \\n  \\n- The location in which they are is a graveyard for poor people that couldn’t afford a proper burial.\\n- Wiz agreed to teach Kazuma Lich skills after their encounter and gave him a card with an address. Aqua wanted to look at the address and go to place a holy barrier around Wiz’s shop to bully her to tears.  \\n  \\n- Megumin mentions that if they had to fight Wiz, she and Kazuma would have probably died. Liches are that strong.\\nBack to the episode, Kazuma’s new outfit scene is basically the same, with the jokes about the frogs and everything. Note how this scene comes before the part in which Aqua begs Kazuma for money. This is quite the change and will be a bit confusing to read, so to make a summary:  \\n  \\nIn the Anime:  \\n1) Kazuma gets his money from cabbages; Aqua begs for money, Darkness got her armor back and Megumin a new orb in her staff.  \\n2) Kazuma gets his clothes.  \\n3) The party learns that there are only high difficulty quest on the board.  \\n  \\nIn the LN:  \\n1) Kazuma goes to buy his clothes with the money he got from Chris. They are yet to receive the cabbage money.  \\n2) The party goes to a quest to kill a “Zombie Maker”. This is Wiz’s introduction, of course Quest Failed.  \\n3) Kazuma chats with people in the guild and learns that a DK General arrived to a castle nearby.  \\n4) Kazuma gets his payment from 1) in the anime and Aqua begs for money, etc.  \\n5) The party learns that the lack of quests is related to the DK’s Generals arrival.  \\n  \\nNow, in the anime, we just learnt that a DK’s general moved near town as the receptionist tell the party that this is the reason why there are only high difficulty quest around. In the LN some random adventurers in the guild told to Kazuma about the general, but not that this is the reason why there are any good quests available since they haven’t checked the board yet. \\nThis scene in the novel is a bit different: Aqua and specially Megumin are pissed at the fact that Kazuma was talking happily to other people while Darkness discovers the new great sensation of being cuckolded.  \\n  \\nKazuma asks to the girls about what skills they have to know if he can learn something new. Darkness has Physical resistance, Magic Resistance, resistance skills for every status condition and Decoy. She doesn’t want to learn Two-Handed sword skills because she might end up killing a monster before receiving a hit.  \\nMegumin knows Explosion, skills that boost the power of explosive magic and high-speed incantation. She is not interested in learning intermediate magic.  \\nAqua gets ignored, and Kazuma says he should find a new party. The girls recoiled.    \\n  \\nNow in the Novel we arrive at the Megumin’s staff scene in which Aqua begs Kazuma for money. Here we get to the scene in which every girl wanted to do a different kind of quest and the party learns finally that there are only high difficulty quest available. There’s nothing to do until the Knight’s from the capital arrive, so Megumin asks Kazuma for their daily explosion trip, the ending of the scene is kinda cute:  \\n  \\n*“…Maybe I can lookf forward to learning Explosion when I’ve finally retired from adventuring.”\\nWe laughed together as we chatted. How many points would we give today’s explosion? Well, the volume was a little low, but the quality of the sound was so good – we went over it piece by piece, chatting away.*  \\n  \\n  \\nThen comes the Dullahan scene, as you can see, the Dullahan scene comes after the explosion trip, with no ‘Aqua crying’ scene in between. It is good to know (because this is getting way too long) that the Dullahan scene is pretty much the same in both the LN and the Anime, so I’ll point out things left in the anime:  \\n- After Megumin says she is from the Crimson Magic Clan, Beldia goes “so that name wasn’t just to mock me”.  \\n- When Aqua enters the scene, Beldia points out that he has prepared countermeasures against priests like her.  \\n- Darkness uses the word hard-core porno to describe what she expects the Dullahan forces her to do.  \\n- Kazuma give details about his plan to take down Beldia with Megumin – alas Solid Snake, he would infiltrate the Castle using his Thief skillset. Plan B would be going the same route as before, day by day firing explosion at his garrison.   \\n- Aqua uses “Sacred Dispel” instead of “Sacred Break spell”.  \\n- There's no mention of a celebration praising Aqua.  \\nI hope next episodes only cut some stuff instead of cutting stuff and changing the order of events.  \\nHere, [have a potato](http://i.imgur.com/YiZBhkQ.jpg)  \\nDon't like potatoes?

       " \"Aricxi 20€ tarp test So I just got back from a [two day loop here in the French Alps](https://www.instagram.com/p/CDS2xz5o-Av/) where the weather was meant to be hot and fine. In fact, we had severe weather warnings for the region with extreme heat (we ended up getting a wild alpine storm, but only the edge of it).\\n\\nSo, naturally I decided this was the prime time to test out my 20€ Aricxi shaped tarp from Aliexpress.\\n\\n[Pics.](https://imgur.com/a/qqbUJUy)\\n\\n[Pics Day 1.](https://www.instagram.com/p/CDS2xz5o-Av/)\\n\\n[Pics Day 2.](https://www.instagram.com/p/CDVcLsCI2js/)\\n\\n[Video.](https://youtu.be/zoWfwzGhDyc)\\n\\nThis is not a review, just a pondering about tarps and whether they're for me or not.\\n\\nI love cowboy camping when I can. I also love my Plexamid shelter. At 450g, it provides me with plenty of room, a fully enclosed living area and a waterproof floor all in a lightweight package. But being DCF and having a ceiling strut, it doesn't pack very small.\\n\\nMy Aricxi tarp on the other hand weighs a little over 300g and packs down to the size of a coffee cup. However, it also needs a groundsheet.\\n\\nI used a section of painters plastic as my ground sheet. It weighed 70g. I should have cut it bigger. I had some rain overnight in the form of a rapid unexpected alpine storm. Nothing got wet, but I would have liked to keep all my gear on a ground sheet. I lowered the sides closer to the ground as the wind picked up. Lifted my head off my pillow and grabbed it just in time as the wind tried to take it away from me.\\n\\nBasically, I stayed dry and I like the idea of a tarp. I love the packed size (**love** the packed size!), I love the open-ness of a tarp and I love the simplicity of putting it up. I wanted to use this cheap tarp to see if I want to invest in a decent tarp for future use.\\n\\nHowever. My Plexamid is a one shelter to do everything. 90% of the time I sleep with the door and vestibule rolled open. Essentially a 'mid shaped tarp with a sewn in floor. I can zip the door shut if there's bugs. I can close the vestibule if it rains. I can scatter my shit around me inside and won't lose it.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI just can't see me using this tarp a whole lot if it's not going to save me any weight. I can't see myself spending a few hundred yoyos on a DCF version either. I want to love the tarp life, but I feel a tent covers all my needs and scenarios. I just wish it packed smaller.\",\n",

       " '[Script offer] Love In the Time Of Dialup [M4F][Bicuriousity][Inexperience][I fap, you fap, we fap, together] The premise for this script is that two teenagers are having a sleepover. While his parents are asleep, they sneak into the computer room (remember when those were a thing?) and look at porn together. He may or may not be downloading the song “Put It On Me” by Ja Rule on Kazaa as this story is taking place—probably not because that would make the internet go way too slow, but that’s neither here nor there.\\n\\nIn my mind, the speaker has very little sexual experience, making him a bit awkward and giving him a limited sexual vocabulary. That’s why some phrases and words are repeated so much. I tried to make him repeat himself while attempting to avoid sounding repetitive, but if you want to substitute some of the repeated words or phrases—“hot” appears in this script 468 times—go ahead. \\n\\nThe parts marked [typing] can have typing noises, clicking noises, both, or neither. Whatever is most natural and easiest for you to record works.\\n\\nFeel free to improvise, especially at the parts immediately surrounding the orgasm. If you have any questions, leave a reply or PM me. Criticism is appreciated!\\n\\nunrelated edit: Should I get verified if all I do is write scripts?\\n\\n***\\n\\n**LOVE IN THE TIME OF DIALUP**\\n\\nSh, shhh, I don’t want my parents to wake up. [giggles] Shhh.\\n\\n[If someone could insert dialup modem noises here and maybe a, “You’ve got mail,” that would be delightful] Is it weird that we’re doing this? I mean, we’re not girlfriend and boyfriend, but I look at porn, and you look at porn, so it’s not weird we’re doing it together, right?\\n\\nIt’s connected! Ok, are you ready? [typing noises] Look at this girl. Ugh, she’s so hot.  [kind of slowly, like you’re enamored by the picture] The way her hair comes down around her face like that and the look in her eyes. It’s like she’s saying, “I want you,” with her eyes. She’s so hot.\\n\\n[typing] Ok, now look at this girl. She’s wearing like a leotard thing, but the middle is see through so you can almost see her boobs. And her tights. Tights look really hot for some reason. I don’t know why.\\n\\nAll right, hold on. [typing] Look at her. Oh my god, she’s so gorgeous. Her boobs and her face, they’re just so good. I don’t even know what it is, something about her face, it’s so pretty. She kinda looks like you. [awkward pause]\\n\\nOk, now show me what you like.\\n\\n[pause as female character brings up a picture]\\n\\nEw, that’s nasty! I don’t wanna look at dudes! That’s gross; I’m not gay.\\n\\n[insert pause for imagined female dialogue]\\n\\nYeah, but I didn’t think it would be guys. I don’t know. I didn’t think anybody looked at guys on the web. [slight pause to look at picture] I mean, how can you like that stuff? He’s just so big and…muscly. [slight pause to look at picture some more]\\n\\nOk, my turn again. [typing] Oh my god, she’s so hot. I love how she has her legs spread and her knees up. You can just see—*everything*. Her vagina makes me want to lick the computer screen. [giggles] Shutup, don’t laugh at me. It’s a good looking vagina! [slight pause] Hey, I don’t know if this is weird, but [hesitantly] do you think…could I maybe see your vagina? I don’t wanna touch it or anything because we’re not dating, but do you think I could see yours? I can show you my…thing, too, if you want.\\n\\n[pants removal break]\\n\\nWow, that’s really…that’s really nice. And pretty or something. I mean, it’s really hot. [awkward chuckle] It just looks really…I like it. Well, this is my penis, I guess. It’s an all right penis. It’s already sort of…excited right now because we’ve been looking at these pictures. [pause]\\n\\n[awkwardly] So, um, I mean, I ‘m already kind of turned on, and we’re already looking at porn; would you mind if I just sort of…took care of it while we’re doing this? You can touch yourself, too, if you want.\\n\\n[commence stroking] \\n\\nYour turn. Show me a picture. [girl brings up picture] Aw, ew. I told you I didn’t want to look at guys, especially when I have my dick out! [curiosity is piqued] Even though he *is* kind of—I mean I guess I could see what you like about him, that’s all. He does have really nice arms. I’m not saying I like them or anything, but they are really nice. And I don’t get why they’re so shiny, but his abs are really good, too. I guess.\\n\\nAll right, my turn. [typing] I really like this picture. She’s kinda fat, but that’s cool. Like, how fat or skinny a girl is doesn’t really have anything to do with how hot she is. And I really like that thing she’s wearing, it’s all lacy and—a teddy? Is that what it’s called? Like teddy bear? That’s strange. But I really like it. It makes me wanna run my hand over it and play with her nipples through the material.\\n\\n[girl brings up picture] Hey wait, don’t—aw gross! [somewhat unconvincingly] Why is he wearing an unbuttoned suit with his penis out like that? It’s all thick and…[completely unconvincingly] nasty. His face is really kind of…nice though, I guess. I like his stubble.\\n\\nLet me show you this girl. [typing] Her black hair looks kinda emo, but I like it. And I really like when girls wear guys’ t-shirts. She’s definitely not wearing bra underneath. It’s almost like it’s her boyfriend’s or something and she just wants to be wrapped up in him. Like they just got done having sex and they’re gonna have sex again later. And the way she’s biting her lip—it just drives me crazy.\\n\\n[*stroking intensifies*]\\n\\nOk, I want to see another one of your pictures. [girl brings up picture] Haha, oh wow. He’s definitely hard. Not like a little bit hard or kinda hard but all the way rock hard. [completely enthralled by the picture] Don’t laugh at me, but that’s actually kinda…hot. That look on his face is just like he *needs* to fuck somebody right *now*. He’s got really toned thighs, too. And his penis…his cock just looks so…hard. And it’s pretty. Like, I don’t know how, but that’s a really *pretty* cock. It’s all veiny, and the head’s all shiny and smooth. [surprised by the sensations] This might make me have an orgasm.\\n\\nI…I could see why you might be attracted to him. Like, if a girl wanted us to, I might make out with him to just impress her. I don’t think I’d even be that grossed out. I usually like girls because they have curves, but I could see myself running my hands over his abs just to see what they feel like. But his cock. It’s just so…pretty and right there. I might think about tasting it if the girl liked it, maybe sucking it a little. Until it’s all big and veiny like that.\\n\\nAnd then one of us could have sex with the girl while she sucks the other one off. We could take turns on her. Or maybe we put her in between us, and we both fuck her at the same time, just in and out of her pussy and ass. She’d be sandwiched in between, and all three of us would make out. I wonder if I’d be able to feel his cock inside of her while we’re fucking. Holy shit. [almost confused] Holy shit, I’m gonna cum. [turned on, confused, and surprised] I’m cumming! I’m cumming!\\n\\n[Let the cummies flow through you]\\n\\nWow. [pause to catch breath] I don’t know what just happened. I think I just got really turned on by a guy. I’m not sure what to think of that. Did you…did you, uh, finish? Wow, that was really hot. [pause to continue catching breath] Hey, do you want one of my t-shirts to sleep in tonight?',\n",
       " 'Cross-nursing [UPDATE] Hi everyone! Just want to give you a follow up to my previous [post on cross-nursing](http://redd.it/ydpua). It went well. I only needed to nurse the 3 month old boy once, since my friend (his mom) fed him right before she left, and then right after she came back 3 hours later. He was an easy going baby, so he fed from me with no problem. (\"Oh, a nipple? I know what to do with that.\") \\n\\nThe one having an issue was actually my 4 month old girl. But she\\'s always very clingy, that\\'s just her personality. So she couldn\\'t understand why she was on the bouncer and not on me. They started napping, then woke up around the same time, and they both have the habit of nursing once they\\'re up. So if I could do anything differently with these two, I\\'d have them take their naps at different times. That way I  could nurse one without the other fussing from hunger/wanting to be with mommy.\\n\\nBut as I said, it went well all things considered. Everything that I was worried about ended up being a non-issue. My friend\\'s baby took me, it felt natural even though he wasn\\'t mine, and there was no problem with my milk supply. (I was gonna drink the milk tea someone here had recommended, but I didn\\'t have the time to look for it.)\\n\\nAnyway, I just want to say thank you for the encouragements and the stories. I very much enjoy reading about other women helping out each other with their milk, whether it was directly or pumped. Seriously, it does take a village. So kudos to you, ladies! You rock!\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"My Barbarian Assualt Experience I would like to award the following RSNs: Cameltjuhh, Intense Ltd, Ralph Wigum and Geonaute with the Medal of Honor, the United States of America's highest military honor, awarded for personal acts of valor above and beyond the call of duty.\\n\\nSo I started playing on my Zerk again and decided to get a  torso tonight and given the state of barbing with randoms, I knew I was in for a long stressful evening. After a couple of failed teams, I finally seemed to be on a team that was here to stay. As the waves progressed, my frustration grew. The team consisted of low levels 70-86ish combat, (highscore them if u want) in gear like rune, granite and sht. These noobs weren't calling their horns, asking questions such as 'how do I collect' and 'are super pots needet' [wtf???]. The worst part was the collecter asked how do I collect on wave f*****g 6....lol. Being someone who has a fair amount of BA experience (8+ items), you could understand why I was getting frustrated. Our attacker, Ralph Wigum, took absolutely ages to even clear the lower waves, collecter wasn't calling out styles, healers just about kept us alive. I was ready to leave because I thought theres no way on earth we will ever make it and I've never been more wrong in my life.\\n\\nThe most important battle of our lives came, wave 10, after a brief pep talk in the lobby (3 mins, discussing how to make omega eggs cause none of them knew lol) we entered. Things started how I expected, slow and hard, the two healers worked non stop mending the wounds of war, attacker took absolutely ages, I was the collector so I was chilling lol and to my disbelief, we made it to the queen!!!!\\n\\nThese brave heros had already exceeded all expectations I had for them so we had nothing to lose, once all the eggs were collected, it was show time, after rigorous healing and only going out one by one accompanied by a healer, we each did our parts, the omega eggs were ready and we were so close. So I go and load the cannon and fire at the queen and guess what, THERE WERE STILL 2 PENANCE RUNNERS AT LARGE WHO HAD ESCAPED THE WATCHFUL EYE OF OUR DEFENDER. THE DRAMA. We searched and finally cannoned the b***h down and killed the queen with me having 15 hp to spare, talk about clutch.\\n\\nThis was single handedly the best experience of my RS life. I am sorry for judging you guys and thinking the worst of you, you are not noobs, but heros!!!!!! As a show of my appreciation I awarded them all with rune items, one guy got rune plate cause he was in a rune chain lol...\\n\\nSorry about the long read but I just HAD to share this, I now leave you with a quote:\\n“In the end, people should be judged by their actions, since in the end, it was actions that defined everyone.” \\n― Nicholas Sparks\",\n",

       " 'Generous People DO still exist!! Today I was reminded of the simple fact that being kind to your fellow human is uncommon but not unheard of. I work with a truly remarkable group of people. This week one of our coworkers was in an altercation with her boyfriend, and father of her two children. He has a drinking problem and he essentially attempted to beat her up in front of their children. She wears glasses and it is a necessity in her case. At some point in their altercation, he hit her and broke her glasses. Between the two of them she is the only one employed and she literally supports the four of them and his daughter from a previous relationship on her bank teller paycheck. As of right now a new pair of glasses is not in their budget. Today is her first day back this week since their fight (she has also kicked him out of their house thankfully). She is literally holding transactions to her nose and can barely see them. It literally broke my heart. One of the girls at my work, bless her tender heart, went ahead and set up an eye appointment for her and has made arrangements to pay for both the appointment and the glasses. I am blown away by how this seemingly simple act can drastically alter someone’s perspective on life. It is so remarkable to me how she was able to convey to our dear coworker that, even though she is broken down in a seemingly hopeless situation for her and her children, somebody still cares about her. It’s just amazing how she not only possibly changed the perspective of a coworker, but she also changed mine. I am so proud to call this generous soul my coworker and dear friend. It’s times like this when I am grateful to have someone in my life who is a fierce friend and an all around good person. Props to you, girl!! You are a blessing to all those who know you. In conclusion to my little rant and rave about my awesome place of employment and the people that work within it, I hope that you all have a blessed day and the opportunity to either experience or exhibit a random act of kindness today! \\uf04a',\n",

       " 'My head cannon that will piss off JK Jeremy always felt like he was different from everyone else, like he didn’t quite fit in, so when he received a visit on his 11th birthday by the headmaster of a magic school explaining to him that he was a wizard, he felt relieved. Finally, he would be able to make sense of himself. His first year as a muggle-both wizard at Hogwarts was the most wonderful experience of his life, and he felt more comfortable among his schoolmates, particular his fellow Gryffindors, as he ever had back home in the muggle world. But something still wasn’t quite right. \\nThroughout his second year, he could not deny that his inner turmoil, though he didn’t know what to make of it. Maybe he wasn’t ready, or rather too scared to accept what his deepest instincts were telling him. \\nAt the end of the school year, he overheard a group of 6th year boys talking in the Gryffindor common room. They were plotting to find a way to trick the staircase to the girls’ dormitory into letting them go up without turning into a slide, so they could visit their girlfriends. \\nThat conversation bounced around his head all summer, haunting his every thought. On the last day of summer vacation, he made up his mind - he had to know. \\nAfter the start of school feast, once everyone was settled in for the evening, he crept out of his dormitory and made his way to the deserted common room. Standing at the bottom of the staircase to the girls dormitory, his heart beating out of his chest, he clenched his fists and closed his eyes. He climbed the first step tentatively. Nothing happened. Then another step. And another. With complete peace of mind, Jeremy made it to the top of the stairs that never turned into a slide and opened her eyes. The castle had accepted her for who she was all this time, even though she hadn’t known it herself.',\n",

       " \"Entitled mother and child are far too important for waiting in line. So I was playing mini golf with my brother and my dad. We are about two holes in when we notice a fat EM and her bratty son (about 7 or 8 years old, I would say). The whole place is pretty backed up, and everyone's kinda waiting for the person in front of us to finish. At hole 4, my dad and my brother still have balls on the green when EK decides he's tired of waiting and hits his ball... right into my dad's ball, pushing it about 3 feet away from the hole. EK continues to hit the ball (with terrible form, even for an 8yo) while we all just stare at him in silence. Except for EM, who is on her phone, not even paying attention.\\n\\nWe finish up the hole, but now there's yet another person we have to wait for since he wen't ahead of us. The whole situation just felt worse than it actually was because, in comparison to the EK, there was this really cute kid behind us (he looked about 6 years old) who actually waited patiently with his mom and played well too.\\n\\nSo we slowly make our way through the course, and then hole 9 comes along. I see EK is still just *so much more important that the rest of us*, and just walks in front of the group ahead of him, who were actually really good at mini golf. This was when things started to heat up.\\n\\nNG1 (Normal Golfer #1): Excuse me buddy, we were ahead of you, so you have to wait your turn.\\n\\nEK:  Nobody cares. Lemme golf!\\n\\nNG2 (Normal Golfer #2): Ma'am, your son just cut in front of us.\\n\\nEM: (Finally looks up from her phone) Yeah, and? Stop making such a big deal, its just a game. He can do what he wants.\\n\\nNG2 figures its pointless to talk to her and just goes back to putting while NG1 is still talking to EK\\n\\nNG1: Listen, you can't just do that. Everyone's gotta respect each other so we all have a good time. You disrespected us, and those people too (gesturing to me and my family).\\n\\nEK: MOOOOM, this stranger won't let me play golf!\\n\\nEM: Stop harassing my child, you awful creep! If I see you talking to him again I'm calling the cops!\\n\\nAt this point, people on other holes start watching since the EM is getting to the point of shouting.\\n\\nNG1: But ma'am, your child is rudely cutting us and the people behind us. We got here first, so we go before he does. He needs to learn to wait and be respectful to other people.\\n\\nEM is turning red and EK has developed a huge scowl on his ugly face. He starts whacking the ground with the club and making a fuss.\\n\\nEM: DON'T YOU EVER TALK TO ME ABOUT WHAT MY BOY NEEDS. I AM HIS MOTHER AND YOU ARE A USELESS VIRGIN, SO SHUT YOUR MOUTH.\\n\\nAt this point the manager comes by and asks what is going on.\\n\\nEM: THIS MAN IS A PEDOPHILE WHO IS TRYING TO CUT IN FRONT OF MY SON\\n\\nManager: Sir, is this true?\\n\\nNG1: No, her son has cut two groups and she is completely overreacting.\\n\\nNG2 and my dad both say the same thing.\\n\\nManager: Ma'am, please move back behind this family (us) and be quiet, or I will have to ask you to leave.\\n\\nThe EM, still red, stomps behind us, muttering curses and insults, and her EK follows, still having a mini temper tantrum. A few holes later, he hit me in the ankle with his club. I look down at him and grin the best grin of my life so far. He scowled up at me. I laughed quietly. We get to the end and finally leave, but first I say to the EM: I hope your day is as pleasant as you are.\\n\\nShe starts cursing at me and gives me the finger, but I'm already crossing the street and on my way to the car.

       " \"YAAP: First ascension after the NAO migration (realtime speedrun) At the moment the new server was open for playing, i decided to try a speedrun. My ping had improved from 180ms RTT to 120ms, and so i was confident to get a good time. To make things even more interesting, speedrunning champion Parad0xx decided to try a run, too. \\n\\nFor the run i chose a lawful human valkyrie, the combination i am most comfortable with. The game started extremely good, by getting a DL:6 throne wish (sceptre of might, sokoban was not done yet). Sokoban yielded a BoH and a ring of teleport control, so i could go for teleportitis right away.  \\n\\nDuring the midgame i was able to obtain all the neccessary resistances. The castle was done reflectionless, with a blue dragon destroying most of my wands and all of my (foolishly) unbagged rings (including the =oTC, but luckily i had a backup). Additionally i got a castle throne wish. The quest was not spectacular, i spent my last WoW wish on a wand of death against Lord Surtur. \\n\\nGehennom was done really quickly, with Vlads throne giving another wish.\\n\\nAfter finding the VS and killing Rodney i wanted to use Asmodeus for fetching the amulet for me ([see here](https://nethackwiki.com/wiki/Asmodeus#Other_uses)), but it turned out he just was not where he was supposed to be (i met him in the VotD later on the asc run, so he most likely drank cursed potion of gain level), which forced me to use Baalzebub instead, but he did his job very good :).\\n\\nAt that point in time i allowed myself a short break and found out that Parad0xx was about to kill Rodney, so it was still a close race. The ascension run went rather unspectacular, apart from Orcus being a bit annoying and being forced back on Asmos level twice (the last level before the VotD). On DL:1 i stupidly wasted some time and resources preparing for the planes. At this point, Parad0xx was still in the middle of the ascension run, so if nothing went wrong on the planes, i should win the race.\\n\\nThe planes went very smooth again, with Rodney making a short appereance somewhere on Air, Fire or Water (don't remember). Astral was done without my preferred setup because i lacked a ring of free action. The second altar was the correct one, and so i was able to do the first ascension on the new server. \\n\\nCoincidentally i was also the *last* person ending a game on the *old* instance (again, with an ascension).\\n\\nRealtime: **2h14m** (personal best, #9 fastest realtime on NAO for now)\\n\\nGametime: **12255** turns (personal NAO best)\\n\\n\\n[Dumplog](https://alt.org/nethack/userdata/s/stenno/dumplog/1439318536.nh343.txt)\\n\\n[ttyrec part 1](https://alt.org/nethack/userdata/s/stenno/ttyrec/2015-08-11.18:42:14.ttyrec)\\n\\n[ttyrec part 2](https://alt.org/nethack/userdata/s/stenno/ttyrec/2015-08-11.19:51:45.ttyrec)\\n\\n[ttyrec part 3](https://alt.org/nethack/userdata/s/stenno/ttyrec/2015-08-11.20:33:59.ttyrec)\\n\\n[NHS stats page](https://scoreboard.xd.cm/players/s/stenno.all.html)\\n\\n\\n--- alt.org ping statistics ---\\n\\n10 packets transmitted, 10 received, 0% packet loss, time 9013ms\\n\\nrtt min/avg/max/mdev = 113.701/114.045/114.542/0.438 ms\",\n",

       " 'The adventures of Pete and BJ - Episode 1 Hello. My name is Peter and this is my first post. I’m doing this as a record of my wife Bobbi Jo’s fun times…hope you enjoy the stories…\\n\\n\\nWe started all of this because BJ is insatiable in bed, a nympho who gives the best head ever. It’s true. She has no gag reflex which means she can take me deep in her throat and stick her tongue out at the same time to lick my shaft and balls. She also swallows. So over time I kept telling her my fantasy of seeing her with another guy…as her cock sucking talent needed to be shared. She agreed without much ado.\\n\\n\\nSo, we recently posted online for a guy interested in the MMF scene…but the understanding was that BJ would meet him alone first to gauge compatibility. We also agreed that maybe one-on-one sex with any guy meeting her criteria was an option if she felt the desire. The only rule was that she would have to keep me posted as the night progressed. \\n\\n\\nLast evening, after several weeks of email communication, BJ was going to meet a new friend for the first time over drinks. Unfortunately, at the last minute the guy sent message that he wanted to dress casual. That meant BJ would be overdressed in her tight black skirt and heels. What bummed me out most was that she wasn’t wearing panties and the thought of her meeting a guy like that was very hot. \\n\\nSo anyway, she changed into tight jeans, a form fitting shirt and black heels. BJ is a slender and sexy older woman...very attractive and gets attention from men of all ages.\\n\\n\\nAfter about an hour of meeting her new friend, the first message I received was that she and he were in the bar having beers. She noted everything was ok as he was a nice guy and I would like him. She told me he was second date material which meant he met her criteria. BJ said she wasn’t sure of the next step but indicated that she was ‘maybe’ ready to go there. I responded that I was so hard knowing she was even thinking about a next step.\\n\\n\\nA half hour of silence, then I received a message from BJ saying she ‘loved hearing I was hard’…and then more silence. Another hour until next message and BJ said she was on way home and I’d better be ready for sex. Hell yes I was ready.\\n\\nSo she gets home, and we go into the candle lit bedroom where I had wine chilled and music playing. She loved the nice touch but said she had to take a shower first…my first hint she had more than drinks.\\n\\n\\nOnce we were in bed, we toasted to her fun and started the discussion of who he was, where the conversation went and her attraction to him. She then told me that because her friend was short on time, that after a few beers they decided to go to the car to get to know each other better. BJ drove to a secluded spot behind an office building in the area where they proceeded to make out…kissing and fondling. \\n\\n\\nBJ then unzipped his pants, pulled out his cock and then went down on her new friend. After enjoying it for a short while, he told her it was the best head he ever had but he really wanted to be inside of her. She quickly stripped off her jeans and straddled him on the front passenger seat of her small car. They continued kissing…which makes BJ really hot…while she fucked him. Needless to say, the guy came inside of her which she said she was okay with as she really liked him. They dressed, she dropped him off at his car and then came home.\\n\\n\\nBJ and I then proceeded to fuck and suck all night and again this morning. I can’t say it was the best ever because she is always awesome in bed. However, the sex was more intense knowing she was living as a hotwife and not just in a fantasy.\\n\\n\\nThe emails they shared today were about how much they enjoyed meeting and that they could not stop thinking about the encounter. They are already planning a second meeting and he promised to find more appropriate accommodation so that it could all be about pleasing her. I’m pretty sure that excited her.\\n\\n\\nI’ve been hard all day waiting for her to get home. She is napping right now but said she wanted to talk more this evening about what happened. I think we likely will have crazy sex again in a couple hours.\\n\\n\\nPlease don’t ask for pictures. We have to be discrete and only share with those she is interested in meeting.\\n\\n\\nTL;DR: BJ sucked and fucked her new friend on the first meeting. Hot.\\n',\n",

I was getting flatline upon flatline including severe depression, anxiety, irritably, fatigue, extreme brain fog, etc... but once you get through that, it's a breeze.

Whenever you feel the urge just go to the gym \\n4.) unfollow all models or hot girls you follow on social media like insta: they make urges stronger and definitely don't help\\n5.)

       " \"(Spoilers Main) Jon, Daenerys, Cersei, and power. GRRM enjoys his historical parallels, and I must admit I do too. Since last week's episode, I've been chewing on the Big 3 (Cersei, Deny and Jon) axis of power in Westeros, which I'm almost certain is faithful to the endgame of the books. These are the leaders who, through maneuvering, merit, resources and intelligence (yes, even Cersei) have managed to outlast all the rest to become a finalist in the Game of Thrones. \\n\\nBut what of the system that supports and enforces their power? The scene in the presence chamber with Daenerys and Jon provides an excellent juxtaposition for how power can be derived and weilded, and not without supporting historical parallels.\\n\\nConsider Jon. He shows up with relatively little fanfare, unimpressive escort and disheveled appearance. He presents himself to Daenerys as first amongst equals (his lords and bannermen). This is reminiscent of the old Anglo-Saxon kings of England, who were typically elected sons from great houses, or sometimes proven warlords (both of which describe Jon's position). Historically, this describes a system of **meritocracy**, which means that the person who, at the end of the day, shows the most skillful qualities of leadership is the one who is the heir apparent. This is a bit different than a democratic election, like the Kingsmoot or for the position of commander of the Night's Watch- meritocratic election requires more or less unanimous motioning for the position to be legitimized. In fact, Jon's rise to power more closely resembles Mance Rayder's than any other king or queen in the series.\\n\\nFor the North and Jon, this creates a political system that is calles a **limited monarchy**, a design of Anglo-Saxons and apparently the First Men. What this means is that Jon's actions as a leader are beholden to not just him, but his supporters. As we've seen in the last and current season, important matters are taken to court and put to a popular motion. If Jon defies the will of his lords and it turns out poorly, he will be subjected to their disapproval, and quite possibly, lawfully deposed. Even if he defies the vote and it turns out well, he still risks losing the confidence of his lords incrementally. On the other hand, if he acts in faith with his lords, even if he does not think it wise to do so, it may spell out catastrophe and failure. Some decisions are best not put to a vote.\\n\\nWhile a system of limited monarchy more closely resembles a democratic society, it is not always a favorable way to rule, particularly when a leader cannot convince the people he is answerable to on an important matter. This is where we can see Daenerys' strengths. In the presence chamber scene, she is putting forth an image of **imperial power**- not first amongst equals but the unquestionable center of authority. She positions her wise, important people around her, to give legitimacy to her assertions, since having wise, important servants willingly obliging her gives other leaders a sense of nobility and preparedness. \\n\\nMoreover, skillful advisors are actually essential when it comes to successful imperial rule- while the monarch must act with single authority, they will not maintain power in the long term without listening to their experts, which I'd argue Daenerys recognises quite shrewdly. While Jon, when acting in faith with his lords, will shoulder equal burden of responsibility with them, in imperial monarchy she is the only one to shoulder that burden, and if she makes enough wrong moves, she will be met with a quick drop in power. Daenerys reminds me of the Roman emperors of the Classical age- coming and conquering, but aquiescing and compromising when it is wise to do so.\\n\\nAnd now for Cersei. A classic **tyrannical ruler**, this type of rule is obviously based on brute force, discarding of any dissenters to create an insular circle of obligers, and using underhanded diplomatic tactics like spying and sabotage to shake off those who would oppose her. This type of government is truly autocratic- while imperial rulers act alone, good ones will allow for advisors and diplomats to try to persuade them in privacy. Cersei will not tolerate corrections, will not listen to advice. She acts on instinct, like a predator, ruthlessly crushing any who oppose her. Her only consorts are those who oblige her completely. \\n\\nWhile eliminating foes to establish your position is actually a decent way of ensuring power, the weakness that inevitably follows almost always leads to collapse. If you act selfishly and alone, the only person that the people you govern over can point to is you, and when a better contender for leadership is able to rally support, the result is almost always a complete fall from grace, a.k.a., deposition and execution. Brute force almost always leads to eventual retaliation. Just like Aerys II, you cannot maintain your grasp on power through it because you are eventually going to piss off the wrong person.\\n\\nSo while the Queens of Westeros are both autocrats, through them we see examples of how to do it well, and how to do it badly. Cersei gains advantage by eliminating foes and Daenerys does it by making friends and granting leniency when she believes it will make her a new ally. One thing I find interesting about Daenerys is that she is a fast learner and nothing if not pragmatic during her short time in Westeros. I feel that, through Jon, she may adopt and implement some of the tenets of governance by consent and limited monarchy, because she will see how it benefits and adds to his legitimacy, something that Daenerys kind of lacks. And in turn, Jon may learn from her that at times he must act decisively for the benefit of his people, instead of wasting time and possibly goodwill if there is dissent, by putting essential matters to vote. \\n\\nBetween Jon and Daenerys, ice will melt and fire wiIl cool. As underdogs, they will understand the importance of governance by consent as well as ruling by authority. I believe this will be the 'happy ending' of the series, when the two most successful candidates to the Iron Throne create a new style of leadership, and usher in a new age of Westeros, and a ruling partnership between equals. \",\n",

       " \"Strange lights in suburbia [ME] I am posting this on a phone so please excuse any typos. I figured this might be the place to describe some odd events that happened to me more than 10 years ago.\\n\\nIn 2001, my parents moved into a neighborhood that had heavy tree cover. Each house had a large lot with dense trees typically surrounding three sides. We were on a corner lot that backed up to the woods. At night, it was dark and you couldn't see much outside. My bedroom was on the second floor in the front. There was a dense patch of trees in front of my window that didn't let much light through. Small details but because of them, I never figured out what was going on. \\n\\nAs I was coming home at night from  a walk around the neighborhood, I saw a flash of purple light in the back of my neighbors lot. It was a single flash that lit up their backyard. I was confused, non-reactive, and just continued walking home. Within a span of a few months, I had seen the same light between my lot and a neighbor's and also on the main road that my street connects to. When I saw the light near my house, I was with my mother and brother. They weren't looking in the same direction as me and when I asked if they had seen it, they said they didn't. From there I chalked it up to my eyes playing tricks on me. Even now I don't think it was paranormal,  I just don't know what it was. The next bit I just don't even know what to think.\\n\\nA year and a half after moving to the woods, a large yellow labrador retriever followed my brother home when he was jogging. This dog was tired, hungry, a little muddy, but very friendly. He had a collar so he must have gotten lost from his owners. Since it was getting late, my parents decided to take the dog in for night and call Animal Control in the morning. After a quick meal and brushing, my parents set him up in the family room for the night. My dog was very excited to have a friend for the night. I decided to sleep on the couch and keep an eye on the both of them.\\n\\n The family room is in the back of the house and looks out into the woods. There's not too many reasons to go back there aside from dumping grass clippings. There are no walking trails and invasive thorns have taken over a lot of it. The elevation drops just after our lot ends and keeps going downward. It maybe starts to climb again when you are 1/4 mile into the woods. \\n\\nAnywho, I propped my self on the couch, turned off the TV and stared out the sliding glass doors into the woods. The dogs were playing and engorged in their own world of chew toys. After a few minutes I saw a line of white glowing lights appear in the woods. When I say they glowed, they radiated and varied in intensity like a star.They must have been a ways back because they were at eye level. I stared for a few moments in awe. After my nerves kicked in, I ran yelling and screaming into my parents room to tell them what I saw. They of course didn't believe me and sent me back to watch the dogs. When I came back, the dogs were merrily playing and the strange lights were gone. That night I opted to sleep with a baseball bat under my pillow. Teenager logic.\\n\\nRoughly a week after seeing the strange lights, I had another incident. I decided to go to bed early since there was nothing else to do. I turned off the lights and sat wide awake in bed. After 10 minutes (I was staring at my alarm clock) I saw what looked like a spot light appear and it swept across the floor. It originated from the top of my window in the middle. The blinds and curtains were closed so I didn't know what was causing it. It swept the floor in front of the window twice and vanished. There were no noises associated with it. It was dead silent. I sat in the corner silent until it was gone. I then ran out of my room.\\n\\n I tried to think what it could have been. If someone were on the roof to shine a light in, I would have heard something. If it was a distance away, the light wouldn't of come through due to the trees or at the very least, shadows would have been cast.\\n\\nI used to wonder what would of happened if I threw an object into the path of the spot light. I wonder if that would have changed the story. Since then I never liked putting my bed near the window.\",\n",
       " 'Me [21F] with my grandparents [70s], feeling pressured into taking a job offer that isn\\'t in my best interests. I finished university in June, and following this moved out of my parents and in with my grandparents because I was having some issues at home. For the most part things have been okay. I wanted to take a break to relax and travel a bit after graduating before settling down and finding a job because my time at university was a lot of hard work but ever since I graduated, there has been a lot of pressure on me to start earning money straight away so I can contribute towards the costs of the household. \\n\\nI cut my relaxing time short and started looking for work at the end of June. My degree is Biochemistry and I knew that I didn\\'t want to do research but wasn\\'t sure what I did want to do so I applied for some jobs as lab technicians. Shortly after this I realised what I really want to be which is a researcher in the financial sector. \\n\\nI have applied for many graduate jobs doing this and had a first interview for my dream job at the end of July. I should hear back about a second interview in the next week. One of the things questioned at the interview was my lack of relevant work experience which is due to me only recently deciding that this is what I want to do. Not many other places have gotten back to me so I\\'m planning on writing to local firms to ask about doing some unpaid work experience because this will help me get into the field I want in the long run. \\n\\nI was surprised to be called for interview at a university for a lab technician job and went to that on Wednesday. Today they offered me the job. I don\\'t want to accept the job because it is a step in the wrong direction for me and would not allow me to get the experience needed to be attractive to the banks I\\'m applying for jobs with. If I reject the job offer then I will no longer receive government jobseekers allowance, my only source of income at the moment.\\n\\nMy family members (particularly my grandmother) are putting a lot of pressure on me to accept the lab job because it would mean I could pay rent (My grandparents are well off and not paying rent does not negatively affect them in any way) but I have struggled a lot with depression and feel that taking a step away from my long term goals could make my life a lot worse. A lot of the graduate programs I\\'m interested in do not accept applicants who graduated more than two years ago so if I take this job for now then it will reduce the number of opportunities available to me. \\n\\nI tried calling the company I had a finance interview with to ask if there\\'s any news on second interviews but the person I need to speak to is on holiday until Tuesday and the lab want me to give them an answer on Monday. \\n\\nScenario 1: Take job, make family happy, probably not get into the incredibly competitive financial job market, be lab tech forever, die. \\n\\nScenario 2: Don\\'t take job, get an unpaid internship, get experience, get job at Asset Management firm, be happy doing what I\\'m doing.\\n\\nScenario 3: Don\\'t take job, write to firms about unpaid internships, get no replies, have no job and no jobseekers allowance, take horrible job that I\\'d hate, be more sad than if I\\'d taken lab job, die. \\n\\n\\n**EDIT: A lot of people keep on saying \"Take the job and apply for other jobs whilst working\". That would be a great plan but I don\\'t have the experience needed for the other jobs and I won\\'t be able to get that if I\\'m working in a completely unrelated field.** \\n---   \\n**tl;dr**: My family are putting a lot of pressure on me to take a paid job that will give me no experience for what I want to do and will reduce the opportunities available to me. How can I deal with this? \\n',\n",

       " 'Day 5 - Rapid Suboxone Detox From Pressed Fent Analogue. Feeling pretty decent (Bernese Method - for those using search function) Hey guys! Just wanted to post my experience for anyone who’s in a similar situation. \\n\\nI’ve been an opiate addict for 10 years. \\nI went onto Subutex maintenance 6 years ago. \\n3 years ago I quit cold turkey in rehab jumping at 4mg a day. \\nI’ve been clean for the last 3 years that is until 3 months ago when I relapsed and started smoking pressed 30’s (fentanyl). \\n\\nI was smoking 10-15 tablets a day. I began to really hate myself. I was hiding this addiction from my amazing wife and my beautiful two boys. I couldn’t handle the guilt and I just wanted my normal life back. I would sit there, smoking the tablets in secret and cry myself to sleep almost every night. I knew I needed to stop. \\n\\nMy first attempt to stop was about 2 months into it. I foolishly tried quitting cold turkey and by the 48th hour I caved. The WD’s were so intense unlike anything I’ve ever experienced. Suboxone, H, and Oxy pales in comparison. \\n\\nI contacted my Doc and got a Subutex script last month (July 10th). After reading so many horror stories about going into PWD 5 days after last dose of fentanyl, I was too scared to try. I couldn’t handle 48 hours let alone 100+ hours And don’t even get me started on the hell that is PWD. \\n\\nI week has gone by since I’ve received my Subutex script and I still haven’t taken the leap yet. I’m scouring the web for a way out. I’m searching through /r/suboxone, /r/opiates, /r/opiatesRecovery and other forums for help. \\n\\nThe Bernese Method. \\n\\nAt last, my answer to a seamless transition to Subutex. Yes folks, it actually does work. I was skeptical as well, and there’s not much information on it. Everything I read is anecdotal (and so is my story) but there’s enough studies and enough “stories” on reddit for me to get enough information to try it myself. My timeline is as follows:\\n\\nI just want to say now that my Fentanyl dose does not drop the entire way through this entire process. I’m not going to write out my Fent dose for each day. Just know it stays at around 10-15 tablets/day\\n\\nDay 1: .5mg Subutex. No noticeable PWD symptoms\\n\\nDay 2: .5mg AM and 5mg PM. No PWD\\n\\nDay 3: 1mg AM and 1mg PM. No PWD \\n\\nDay 4: 2mg AM and 2mg PM. Mild PWD starting to kick in, easily countered using fent. \\n\\nDay 5: 4mg AM &amp; 4mg PM. PWD really starts to set in but countered using fent. Daily fent dose increased by 3-4 tablets. \\n\\nDay 6-11: 4mg AM &amp; 4mg PM. Subutex is officially in my system. I would continue getting mild PWD where I would combat it using Fent. During this phase I would never feel high from the fent. Albeit not in PWD either. Just normal. Fent dose stays increased through this process. \\n\\nDay 12: I abruptly stop taking fentanyl. The true Bernese method requires you to cut your Fent dose down slowly over the course of the program but I just couldn’t do it. I increase my Subutex dose to 12mg. I feel a bit of fatigue and hot and cold flashes but other than that COMPLETELY MANAGABLE. Sleep was fine. \\n\\nDay 13: Sub dose increases to 16mg (kinda pointless). I feel the same as I do on Day 12.\\n\\nDay 14. Stayed at 16mg. Feel the same. \\n\\nDay 15. Decreased dose to 12mg. Feel great. Almost no WD symptoms of any kind\\n\\nDay 16-18: Decrease dose 8mg. Feel totally fine.\\n\\nDay 19-22: Continue to cut dose down in half each day (4mg, 2mg, 1mg, 1mg) and then jumped. Almost no withdrawal symptoms. \\n\\nDay 1-4 Clean: Fatigue and chills, minor aching but sleeping totally fine with help from gabapentin and clonidine. No diarrhea or RLS or stomach cramping. No extremely noticeable mental issues. Completely manageable. \\n\\nOn day 5 today and I know Bup withdrawals can start today. But I know my body well and was on Suboxone for such a short time. I can’t imagine it will get much worst than this. This has been a completely manageable process thus far. Please send me good vibes for Day 5+🙏🏼\\n\\nMuch love to ya’ll! ❤️\\n\\nEDIT: Day 8 and feeling great. Symptoms have improved a bit every day.\\n\\nEDIT 2: Day 28 off subs, Day 38 off Fent and I feel amazing. This is a throw away account but I logged on this morning to check messages and someone DM’d me saying they tried my timeline and successfully made the switch to Subs. Please don’t be afraid to try the Bernese Method. It might sound counter-intuitive but it really does work! Peace and love to everyone! 🙏🏼',\n",

       " 'One Year In - Your Opinions on The Dark line. **The Line as a Whole**\\n\\nWith last week we\\'ve had our first full year of Dark, and I think it\\'s been fairly strong overall.\\n\\nThe Dark has strong cohesion within its little corner of the New52. While other heroes and characters dip in from time to time, it\\'s all, for the most part, within the confines of the Dark, with our twisted heroes rarely showing up in the broader New52. There has been, overall, a lot of inter-Dark crossing over and self referencing. This has lead, in turn, to a great sense of shared storytelling that doesn\\'t involved the need for those coming in off of Vertigo to explore out into the larger 52 if they\\'re not interested.\\n\\n**Animal Man &amp; Swamp Thing**\\n\\nYou really can\\'t talk about one without talking about the other. Both titles have been nothing short of magnificent. And, while both stories are strongly intertwined, only the 12th issues actually require any dipping into the other title for those that only read one or the other instead of both.\\n\\nAnimal Man has been wonderful, picking up the tone of the pre-Infinite Crisis Animal Man and running with it, most heavily inspired by Morrison\\'s excellent run on the character. We seem to have lost some character history during the reboot, but fore the most part Lemire\\'s work doesn\\'t feel like it\\'s treading old ground, and is wonderfully displaying the dynamic of the Baker family. In a world full of grimdark heroes with no spouses, no children, and dead parents, it\\'s nice to see Buddy having a family.\\n\\nSwamp Thing picks up a couple of months after the end of Brightest Day\\'s Aftermath mini, with the reborn Alec Holland, and wonderfully depicts a man coping with the fact that he\\'s been dead for several years. It gracefully handles the characters and builds new concepts on top of Moore\\'s run while respecting it instead of tearing it down. Alec coming into his own over the course of the first 8 issues never felt padded or slow, and the reveal of the new Erl King was suitably spectacular.\\n\\nBoth the Red and the Green were wonderfully detailed, and the Rot doesn\\'t feel forced or cliche, but a legitimate third to this trio. The build to Rotworld has been breathtakingly beautiful and impeccably worded. I fully expect the next year to be as good as the first, with the first half of the year taken up by Rotworld, and unknown wonders to come afterword.\\n\\n**Frankenstein, Agent of S.H.A.D.E.**\\n\\nI, personally, struggled with this title, but am glad I stuck it out. The first two stories really didn\\'t click for me, and the need to go find an issue of OMAC very nearly turned me off. But Lemire\\'s last couple of issues before the handoff to Kindt were much better, in my opinion, and kept me around. And I\\'m glad they did. Son of Satan\\'s Ring was spectacular, and, as many others have said, finally felt like a true successor to Morrison\\'s Frankenstein. Wonderfully surreal and beautifully twisted, this title finally found it\\'s pace and I have great expectations should it keep it up.\\n\\nThe first four months of the next year will tie-in to the Rotworld epic, with Frankenstein co-starring in Animal Man for the latter half of that character\\'s part of the story. I\\'m personally hoping Melmoth and the Sheeda show up at some point, as I think we\\'re long overdue for a continuation of that tale.\\n\\n**DC Universe Presents: Deadman**\\n\\nThe first five issues of this anthology title gives us a New52 revised Deadman origin story, wonderfully updating the characters beginnings for a new age. By shifting the focus away from the cliche *who was my murderer* they broadened the scope of the character in order to focus on more philosophical and mature themes. A wonderful tale overall.\\n\\n**I, Vampire**\\n\\nThis title has simply blown me away. At first glance, I inwardly groaned. *Another* vampire comic, I thought. But I have been pleasantly surprised. It has managed to both feel fresh and interesting while staying within the commonly held vampire mythos rules. Most works I encounter go for the \"our vampires are different\" route, but I, Vampire laps up all the old cliches and runs with them without being camp about it. His crossovers with JLDark help ground his character in the New52.\\n\\nThe next year sees a role reversal, with villains becoming heroes and vice versa, as well as a focus shift to a broader cast of characters and the vampire nation in as a whole instead of just its leaders. Part of me secretly hopes they get Snyder in on this so he can tie it into his American Vampires ongoing.\\n\\n**Dial H**\\n\\nWhile written quite well, this has so far failed to grab hold of me. I don\\'t feel that it\\'s really been out long enough for me to form a valid opinion, and I\\'m going to give it to the end of the first arc to really wow me into keeping it in my box.\\n\\n**Demon Knights**\\n\\nCornell does amazing work in this title. WHile it for the most part is doing it\\'s own thing in the past, it still manages soft tie-ins here and there with artifacts showing up in the Black Room in JLDark, Madame Xanadu being on this team as well as JLDark in the present, and Etrigan soon to be joining the ranks of Stormwatch! Speaking of the characters, we\\'ve got a nice blend of established names and new faces, and the semi-heroic take on Vandal Savage is hilariously awesome.\\n\\nMy only problem is the pacing. The decompression seems a bit much from month to month. Sitting down and reading storylines in one go feels about right however, so I think I\\'ll be buying this one in trades going forward unless I hear differently.\\n\\n**Resurrection Man**\\n\\nResurrection Man has lacked a real focus and sense of direction. The title really hasn\\'t felt like it\\'s going anywhere. It has also lacked any sort of interconnectedness with the rest of the Dark Line, instead having some crossovers outside in the wider New52. This lack of cohesion with the other Dark titles alongside its own meandering tone and lack of overall goal left me feeling unsurprised that the title is getting cancelled and will not be joining us in the second year.\\n\\nI feel this missed a trick by not tying in to either Animal Man or Demon Knights. The character of Resurrection Man has history with both Buddy Baker and Vandal Savage and I think drawing on those connections would have helped cement the title as part of the Dark line instead of feeling like the outlier it\\'s been.\\n\\n**Justice League Dark**\\n\\nMilligan\\'s initial run on this title feels like a continuation of both Vertigo\\'s Madame Xanadu series from a few years back and his own Secret Seven mini from the Flashpoint event. He handles all of the characters well, and it\\'s certainly well written, but it lacks that *spark* that brings it all together.\\n\\nThat all changed when Lemire steps in on issue 9. The title now feels worthy of the \\'Justice League\\' tagline while still retaining its suitably mystic and Dark feel. While no one character is as fleshed out as they would be in a solo title, the team is well written and each person distinct. Lemire\\'s rotating cast will also help to further intertwine the Dark line as the series continues onward into the future, with Frankenstein and Amethyst set to join the team during the latter half of the current arc and the JLD team to show up in the Rotworld Epic over in the pages of Swamp Thing and Animal Man.\\n\\nThis version of the title will apparently also be the link to the outside world, and will the bridge point for the upcoming Trinity War event as the second year rolls forward.\\n\\n**Looking to the Future**\\n\\nWe\\'re losing a title, but we\\'ve got some new titles joining the fray as well! While we say goodby to Resurrection Man, we say hello to Sword of Sorcery and Phantom Stranger!\\n\\nJLDark and Phantom Stranger will presumably be ramping up for Trinity War at some point. Swamp Thing, Animal Man, and Frankenstein will be enmeshed in the Rotworld, as well as getting some tie-ins from outside titles such as The Ravagers, which has been touching on the Red and Beast Boy\\'s connections to it. And Eclipso\\'s Black Diamond will be winding its way to present day throughout the past titles such as Demon Knights, All-Star Western, and Team 7.\\n\\nThe first couple months of the next year look pretty good. Let\\'s hope they can keep up the momentum!',\n",

       " 'CMV: Uber should be allowed to operate in a city only if it is willing to follow the same (or comparable) regulations as the city\\'s regular taxis. Uber is having a very public fight right now with NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio, basically arguing that they should be allowed to compete with yellow cabs in a free market and that consumers should have a choice.  I would find this argument much more convincing if Uber weren\\'t exempt from almost every rule and regulation by which the TLC governs traditional taxi services, on dubious legal grounds.  Yellow (and green) cabs in NYC must comply with many rules, including car safety inspections, emissions checks and other environmental regulations, and driver background checks.  Whether you agree with these rules or not (and I certainly have some questions about some of them), the fact remains that they are expensive to follow and that cost is of course passed on to the consumer by the cabs.  \\n\\n\\nUber is not competing in a free market at all, in the sense of operating more efficiently to offer a lower price-- they\\'re just gouging their competition by flouting the law.  If Uber (or anyone else) disagrees with these laws (such as the regulation of fares), they can of course use the political process to try to get them changed, but in that case they should be changed for regular cabs also.  There should never be a situation where there is one set of rules and regulations for regular cabs and a separate set for Uber.  \\n\\n\\nUber is not and should not be above the law, no matter how cool and \"disruptive\" they might think they are.\\n\\n\\n**TO BE CLEAR: I am not arguing for or against any particular regulation.**  My argument is that, whatever the level of regulation you favor, Uber and yellow/green cabs should be held to the same standard.\\n\\n_____\\n\\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

She panics when she realizes how much she's grown.**\\n\\n---\\n\\nSasha sat by her little sister, Arie’s hospital bed, listening to the metronomic beep of her heart machine. She had spent so long listening to that sound that even at home, it still played in her head as she tried to fall asleep. That was something she couldn’t do anymore, sleep. In some ways, she envied Arie for her six year slumber. And then she shoved the thought from her mind to be replaced by a guilt so heavy it choked her breaths.\\n\\nArie’s six year slumber had ended only yesterday and within eight hours, she had gone back to sleep, though this time, with the promise of waking back up. Sasha squeezed her little sister’s hand. Mom and dad had gone back home in celebration. The doctors had told them that they needn’t worry anymore. But right now, Sasha couldn’t tell the difference between this sleep and Arie’s previous. Would she really wake up in the morning?\\n\\nShould she?\\n\\nSasha dug pointed nails into her palm, her eyes welling with tears. Already, that familiar weight pressed against her lungs so she could only breathe in stuttered inhales. But this time, no matter how she tried, she couldn’t push away the thoughts. What life could Arie have? Would she ever be able to catch up to the other kids? To love and be loved? To understand all the things she missed out on?\\n\\nThere was no way of telling. The doctor’s wanted to perform tests for her cognitive and physical abilities. They claimed that Arie may be able to adjust and live a normal life. Which meant that on the flip side, she also might not. And if she didn’t, she would be Sasha’s burden for the rest of her life.\\n\\nOnce again, Sasha dug her nails into herself, but this time pushing her thumbnail into her leg. The pain brought with it a small comfort, but one that didn’t last long.\\n\\nIt was no use wondering and no use guessing. She had made her choice six years ago when a driver turned right when he should’ve turned left. Arie, at the time, had been out of her seat and on Sasha’s lap. The little girl had only wanted to watch the world pass by through the open window, to feel the wind on her face, to laugh in the sunlight.

       " 'I’ve finally platinumed all three Dark Souls games Every summer (I’m a high school teacher, so I have time off over the summer) I have a gaming project of some kind. Last summer I platinumed persona 5 and finished my 100% run of Breath of the Wild. That kind of thing. This summer - given that it was twice as long due to quarantine - I decided to embark upon something that made me question my life choices on more than one occasion: I wanted to platinum the dark souls series. I’d already done bloodborne (my first souls game and one of my favorite games of all time) and Sekiro (I think the easiest platinum, it only took me about two weeks after release), so why not dark souls? Little did I know I was in for three months of joy, anger, and gratuitous tears both good and bad.\\n\\nNow that I finished my platinum run of DS3 last night, I thought it’d be fun to share some thoughts and musings on the dark souls games here and see what other people thought!\\n\\nFor reference, the order that I’ve played the soulsborne games is as follows: bloodborne when it came out, DS3 (base game, no DLC), half of DS1, Sekiro, finished DS1, DS2, DS3 dlc. I only point this out so that maybe some of my opinions make sense since I didn’t play 1 *first*.\\n\\nDS1:\\n- I feel like this is a hot take, but the least fun for me to actually *play*. Which was unfortunate, because I think it had the best world design and was the tightest of all three. But man, it was rough going that far back behind all the QOL improvements they’ve made over the years.\\n- The hardest of the 3. But I personally think that’s largely due to it being so clunky to play. I do think it was the one that most required you to learn boss mechanics and to git gud if you hoped to beat them, and I appreciated that.\\n- Mentioned already, but I think 1 had the best world layout. The fact that it was so layered on top of itself was so awesome, and showed how much thought was put into placement. But I think my impression was probably tempered a bit by having played bloodborne first, since a lot of the world design ideas were carried into that game.\\n- Speaking of things carrying over, part of me hated how the weapon infusion types weren’t nearly as important in later games as they were in 1. I thought it was interesting that skeletons could only be killed by blessed weapons and the ghosts in new londo had to be hit by cursed weapons or you had to be cursed. It was a neat mechanic that they seemed to abandon going forward.\\n- Pinwheel OP\\n- Artorias lives up to the hype. I didnt think he would. What a great fight and character.\\n- Fuck that archer section in anor londo. I might’ve gotten more angry at that part than I did anywhere else in the game.\\n- Sif :(\\n\\nDS2: \\n- Way better than I expected it to be. I’d always heard it was “subpar”, and “the worst souls game” and while there are things I didn’t like, it was still a great game. I loved the idea of Majula and getting to see my progress reflected in the little community that grew there, and the world layout (like a wheel with a hub and spokes) was really cool.\\n- HOWEVER. It was definitely the least refined of the three, and was the only game I felt had straight up bullshit mechanics. Ridiculous hit boxes, unfair placement and damage, and their idea of “difficult” was apparently to just throw a ton of enemies in a room. It was very frustrating to deal with.\\n- The only one that I found myself thinking “wow this game just keeps going, doesnt it” and not in a good way. \\n- FUCK the ancient dragon.\\n- I would’ve ranked 2 as the easiest of the 3, but between the ancient dragon, and the dlc bosses (I died to Fume Knight on NG+ more times than I think I did in the entire game), and how stupid some of the areas were, I think it’s in the middle.\\n- The pvp was so awful. Backstabs for DAYS. \\n- What the actual fuck is ADP. Who thought that was a good idea. I want a name. I just want to talk.\\n- What the actual fuck is soul memory. What a pointless mechanic.\\n- “Oh the boss is just a giant frog, that’s bori- OH”\\n\\nDS3: \\n- easiest of the 3, but had the best boss designs. Abyss Watchers, Dancer of the Boreal Valley, and Sister Friede are some of the greatest boss fights I’ve played in any game, all around - design, combat, aesthetic, music, everything. \\n- I think Friede might be the best boss in the series. But I think Lady Maria is the best boss in Bloodborne, so maybe I just have a type.\\n- Easiest base game, but Ringed City kicked my ass REPEATEDLY\\n- Slave Knight Gael was such an incredible fight. His cape needs more hit box frames. It wasn’t big enough.\\n- Farming pvp items was the worst thing in any game and pretty much ruined any enthusiasm I had. It was a solid week and a half of just waiting to get summoned and hoping that the host hadn’t either died or killed the invader before I loaded in. And that was if there wasn’t a gank squad just waiting for me. Truly terrible. \\n- I definitely appreciated the references and tie ins to earlier games more now that I’ve played 1 and 2. When you drop down in the dreg heap to earthen peak I said out loud “holy shit”. \\n\\nSoulsborne in general:\\n- bloodborne is the best of all of them. Im not accepting feedback or criticism.\\n- Sekiro has the best combat of any of their games and maybe of any *game*. I can’t wait to see what they do next and I hope that they do more with it.\\n- Where is Elden Ring :c\\n- I thought about tracking down a PS3 copy of Demon Souls, but with how much I struggled acclimating to the combat in DS1, I think I’m just gonna wait for the remaster.\\n\\n\\nI don’t know what to do now haha. The souls games are so unique and fulfilling, I’m kind of sad ive done everything there is to do. I’ve been playing a lot of Hollow Knight since I think that’s pretty close to being a souls game, and I’ve tried Nioh before so I might go back to it, but nothing can quite scratch that soulsborne itch like a From game does. If anybody has any recommendations, I’m open to them! Other than that, good luck and god speed, skeletons.',\n",

       " 'An interesting anecdote about iconography So, to put it short, I was raised in an Assemblies of God family, been always kind of distant from my Catholic grandparents. As traditional Pentecostals, my parents regard the Church as idolatrous, my own father had fallen away from it at age 19 and my mother has been baptized but that\\'s it. \\n\\nWhen I announced to them of my ongoing conversion process, it surprised me they really didn\\'t take it too well (little do they know I wasn\\'t even a Christian for most of the years I spent since I stopped attending church at the local AG - I was 14, am now 28). \\n\\nThe interesting part regarding iconography and statues is that my mother said she didn\\'t want me praying to any saints or in front of images or statues because it would \"bring curses upon me\". Little does she know I\\'ve already prayed quite a few novenas to St. Therese. However, I told her and meant it that I would respect those wishes and not pray using any iconography near her or put something like that in my room inside their house. Then I tried to explain charitably the Communion of Saints, and hey, I think she kind of got it... still waiting for a proper response on that though.\\n\\nThing is, I am a very visual person. I find it very helpful to use icons to keep me attentive and reflective during prayer, and keep me considering the Passion of Christ. So I spent this week kind of considering if I should go back on my words, even though I really want to respect their boundaries and, in love, explain away some of the many misconceptions they hold about the Church.\\n\\nSo today I wake up and run to Mass, and, unbeknownst to me, they\\'re distributing this dear prayer card. It\\'s also one of my favourite depictions of Christ, and the most touching part of liturgy for me is the Agnus Dei. I brought it home and showed it to my mother; she likes it. It\\'s sitting on my computer right now. \\n\\nI got, in a roundabout way, a response to my prayers. This icon will help me keep focused in prayer and no storms will be unleashed because of that. The first step is taken. God works in mysterious ways, my friends; I just wanted to share this.

       " \"Tips on how to recover from a break. If you don't want to read all my personal mumbo-jumbo, just skip to the 'tips' part.\\n\\n\\n**Backstory:** So I had to take a break from Insanity three weeks ago. I had a friend visit me and stay at my place for over a week, and working out with her around was basically impossible. We'd go to sleep late, and by the time I was up, I needed to be at work already, only to come back to her wanting to do something. I felt guilty enough to leave her alone for all of the time I was gone, and then to have work out for over an hour (as well as taking a shower and getting dressed again afterwards) while she just waited...\\n\\n\\nThe point is, I didn't do Insanity for a week and half because of this. I was already on Day 44, and so I thought 'meh. Maybe I can just pick it right up after she's gone!'\\n\\n\\n**Working-out after the break:** I tried to do Max Interval Plyo (Day 45), and I learned what it's like for your body to just go 'Nope!'. I already had a bad feeling of what was going to happen during the warm-up, since I was feeling exhausted by the end of it. Halfway through the first interval I was already taking several rests (compared to the last time I had done this), and by by the end of it, I had absolutely NO energy left. When I saw that the clock still had 26 minutes left, I just went 'This isn't happening'.\\n\\n\\nThis SUCKED. Mainly, because I didn't know what to do. I was obviously not going to restart the whole 'Insanity' program, but I didn't want to just force myself through what was left, mainly because I was doing worse than during my first day of month 2 (Day 36).\\n\\n**Solution:** I created my own 'come-back week' to try to get right back on track with these workouts. This is what I did:\\n\\n\\n* Monday (Day 1): Core Cardio and Balance\\n* Tuesday (Day 2): Rest (I would've done another CC&amp;B, but I had some time issues this day and couldn't fit a workout into my schedule)\\n* Wednesday (Day 3): Core Cardio and Balance\\n* Thursday (Day 4): Core Cardio and Balance (I noticed that I did better this time than I had on Day 34, making me confident about jumping into a workout, but not one from month 2 just yet)\\n* Friday (Day 5): Pure Cardio &amp; Cardio Abs\\n* Saturday (Day 6): Max Recovery\\n* Sunday (Day 7): Rest\\n\\n**Coming back to it:** Since I was able to restart this on a Monday, I went for a 4-mile run. I WOULD'VE done Day 43 here (Max Cardio Conditioning), but I had already driven 8 hours that day (getting back from my family's house), and by the time I came back to my apt, it was 11 PM and my roommates had already gone to sleep. \\n\\nI ran MUCH better this day than I ever had (I was able to jog 3 miles in 30 minutes without stopping), and this gave me the confidence to jump right back to it.\\n\\nAnd so I did. Day 44, which was Max Interval Circuit, ended up just as great as the last time I had done it (if not slightly better). I think what I did helped me out tremendously, but what exactly did I do?\\n\\n**Tips:**\\n\\n* *Recover at least one day per every 2 days you didn't work out.* For example, if you weren't able to work out for 6 days, repeat the last 3-4 workouts you had done previously. If you were already on month 2, I suggest at least the first one be a 'Core Cardio &amp; Balance'.\\n* *Have one of the workouts be 'Pure Cardio'.* This is just an amazing workout because it will still kick your butt even if you are in Month 2. Throw in 'Cardio Abs' if you had gotten done it too already. If you were almost done with the program, you can substitute this with 'Max Cardio Conditioning'.\\n* *If you had more than 3 'come-back' days, have one of them be a 'Recovery' workout.* These recoveries are VERY helpful to help your body recuperate the flexibility you might have lost, as well as help up the soreness. Not working out for about a week might have you feel sore again. \\n* *GET BACK TO IT.* This is the most important thing. Don't lose hope just because your come-back week isn't great. Your body already knows the way to get back *there*, but it is up to YOU to get it right back on track.\\n\\nAny other tips from people who had to take breaks would be helpful. Inconveniences happen, but you shouldn't lose the willpower.\",\n",

       " 'Should I talk to my NMom about depression or keep it to myself? Me and my boyfriend have come to the realization that I have moderate to severe depression. Things in my life haven\\'t really been going so well and I suppose my body is reacting to it. I want to sleep all the time, I genuinely don\\'t want to see anyone, nothing interests or motivates me etc. \\n\\nI am currently stuck living at home with my parents due to financial struggles so I am once again in the \"mode\" of having to be around my Nmom and Nsister. I\\'ve had some serious problems with discussing issues with my mother in the past regarding depression and other serious problems.\\n\\nThe first problem I ever had was a childhood friend of mine who was a boy and two years older than me molested me during a sleepover at a mutual friends. I tried to discuss it with her and she just insisted that I was fabricating the story. I never got any of the counselling I would have wanted at the time so I just shut it down and avoided the friend.\\n\\nThe second problem I had was after that incident a couple years down the road I was pretty depressed and being a teenager I experimented with self hurting to see if it would help disconnect me from the world. I really don\\'t like drugs or alcohol so at the time that seemed like the best getaway. So I broke a razor and cut up my entire arm (at least 30 cuts and all that- not deep enough to warrant a hospital visit but certainly deep enough to bleed and leave scars for a few years)\\n\\nAnyways my Nsister found out that I did it and copped me out and instead of my mother talking to me about it with concern- she simply yelled at me and asked me \"Do you want me to take you to the mental hospital so you can live with crazy people because that is where you will go if you try anything like that again!\" **note** *I have never wanted to die, and since then I have never tried to self hurt again.* \\n\\n\\nThose were just the most outstanding examples I have. So needless to say, I don\\'t really share my problems.\\n\\n\\nSo the thing is, do I do what I think is a responsible thing to do and discuss with them (despite their previous \"solutions\" ) that I am currently working through a depression and either:\\n\\nA) Have my Nmom understand and give me my space \\n\\nor\\n\\nB) Deal with the possibility that she may just end up saying something like: \"Oh you\\'re not depressed, you have no reason to be! If you\\'re sleeping all the time it just means you need to go to bed earlier!, etc.\"\\n\\nOR should I just keep it between me and the boyfriend and try to get through it alone regardless of running the risk of being triggered/annoyed/whatever even further via them?\\n\\nI don\\'t know what to do guys... I feel like if I don\\'t mention something then it is irresponsible of me to not reach out, but I also feel like I will have a rerun of the past and have it ignored. \\n\\nTL;DR: I am going through a fairly bad depression and I wish to discuss it with my family but my Nmom and Nsister may just dismiss me. \\n\\n\\n\\n**EDIT:** Thank you everyone for helping me out with my decision. I can pretty well guarantee that she will have her typical Nmom reaction so I think safest option for my personal health would be to keep her out of the situation entirely. I love you guys. ',\n",

Background: I smoked cigs for a few years in college (terrible habit, I know) and have since then cut all smoking, hookah included, for the last 3 months or so. My LTR always harped on me to quit, even gave me shit like \"I refuse to date someone who smokes\" to which I\\'d always answer with \"I\\'m not making you stay\".\\n\\nAnyways, I have a huge final coming up in a very difficult class, and recently smoked with a study group while we took a break a few days ago. I decided to do this due to taking study aids, and it intensifying the effects. She came back and noticed I smelled like smoke, and immediately started trying to get into it with me. I initially brushed it off with a laugh, then told her my reasoning and there was nothing to worry about. I have no intention of starting again, and have been offered since then and declined multiple times.\\n\\nShe kept coming at me, and I eventually said \"You don\\'t date me to dictate my decisions, you date me because you trust them. Now show it.\" I then told her that I was still studying and didn\\'t feel the need to discuss it further, so I left to the library.\\n\\nIt seems to have blown over pretty well, she\\'s been receptive since then and we had sex when I got back that night. However, I keep feeling like there was a better way to go about doing this. I think she is under the impression I quit for her (I actually owe that motivation to discovering TRP), and I sadly didn\\'t correct this assumption when I should have.

       " \"Try to steal from me? Enjoy your breast milk shower and your poo filled purse! In 2013, myself and a large group of friends went to a music festival. There was one girl with us (I'll call her Rachel....because that was her name.) who was not a part of the insular group of friends. She was a friend of one of the people in the group, but none of the rest of us had ever met her. \\n\\nSo, we get to the mountain and set up camp. My friends and I decide to go see a DJ. Rachel does her own thing and separates from us. We arrive at the very top of the mountain and have fun for a few hours, and decide to return to camp.\\n\\nWhen we return, we all observe Rachel straight up in my tent, looking for valuables. However, this was not my first rodeo, and I made sure to keep my camera, all prescription medications, etc. in a backpack and with me at all times. The entire group immediately confronted her. She was making excuses that were altogether unfounded, saying that she was on drugs and had gotten confused and thought that she was in her own tent. Her tent looked and had an interior NOTHING like mine though. The most glaring example was that mine had a sleeping bag inside it and hers had an air mattress. There were many other examples, and during the course of the confrontation, her story evolved so we all knew that she was lying. \\n\\nFast forward about 24 hours in the future. Rachel is sleeping soundly in her tent. Now, another friend of mine is a new mother, and has a breast pump on her. She has been pumping for the last 24 hours and putting the milk into a jar, saving it. We go in her tent where she is asleep, and my friend pours her half rancid breast milk all over this chick's face. But, we are not done with the revenge there. Rachel did not wake up after having milk splashed on her, so I go back in there and grab her bag. I never had any intent of stealing anything out of it, that's just not me. But, I did take it into a porta potty, and took a huge dump in it and then returned it to her tent! About 6 hours later, she wakes up and grabs her purse and exits her tent and we are all really mean to her....so she packs up all of her stuff and leaves the festival, never noticing that her purse is full of poop.\\n\\nWe all had a great laugh session over this, and it is kind of a big deal type story around where I live.

       " 'I\\'m noticing new triggers, like going clothes shopping... I recently went back to school shopping with my best friend and my goddaughter, and after seeing her run around the mall from store to store, glowing with excitement over the awesome Gorillaz and Minecraft shirts she just found, it triggered a pretty bad memory for me. \\n\\nWhen I (26F) was back in high school, my nstepmom had taken my two stepsisters and I clothes shopping. It was the summer going into my Freshman year, and I had just moved in with my dad and didn\\'t know anyone in my new school district, so I needed to make a good first impression so I could meet new friends. Back then, I guess I was sorta a goth/emo kid. Not to the extent of wearing fishnet and Tripp pants, I was more into ripped jeans and my Misfits shirt. My nstepmom didn\\'t like this, she hated the music I listened to, the clothes I wore, and pretty much everything about me. So when we got to the mall that day, she made it a point to pull me aside and tell me that, \"Anything you buy has to be approved by me first.\", and also \"No black. No skulls. No tshirts.\" I didn\\'t feel like arguing with her that day, especially in public, so I just nodded and went back to ignoring her. Cut to her and my stepsisters dragging me into every horribly girly store in that place, American Apparel, Wetseal, Abercrombie, no place for a chubby goth girl. Nstepmom was getting pretty pissed by the time we entered Forever 21, because I hadn\\'t even picked out one single thing yet. She didn\\'t understand how my sisters had found so many outfits, and I had nothing. I asked if we could please go somewhere where everything wasn\\'t skin tight and covered in glitter, and she just looked at me like she was about to slap me. She got right in my face and said if I didn\\'t shop where they shop, then I wasn\\'t getting any new clothes for school. So I sucked it up, and ended up just getting this horrible green zebra shirt that had some zippers all over it. It was ugly and way too fucking small on me, but I got it anyways, because it wasn\\'t covered in glitter. And of course my dad did nothing about it when I got home, nobody ever bothered arguing with her, its too exhausting, so she basically just got her way all the time. I also ended up getting my step sisters old clothes, which was horrifying considering one was a super prep who dressed like a slut and listened to Nelly, and the other was an avid church goer who lived in sweaters an mom jeans. A week later, I wore that tiny ass ugly zebra shirt to my first day of school, and the moment I stepped onto the bus, some asshole in the back starts singing, \"Fat girl in a little shiiiirt!\". I was fucking horrified. That was the first impression I made on these people. They called me that, fat girl in a little shirt, for like 2 months until I started making friends. Eventually my best friend (still to this day) started keeping my  tshirts at her house and bringing one to school for me everyday to change into. Until one time my nstepmom showed up at school one day to surprise us, saw me in my Zelda shirt, and freaked the fuck out on me, right then and there. \\n\\nAnyways, it was humbling to watch my God daughter run around shopping for herself, making her own choices, being her own person, and not being made to be ashamed for it. I almost cried a little. Thanks for listening to me get that off my chest. ',\n",

Hey everyone, I\\'ve been a long time lurker, I\\'ve commented a few times but this is the first time I could actually come close to articulating something to post. I initially joined this subreddit because my mom was RBN (she was the SG) and I wanted to gain a better understanding of her up bringing and kind of push her in the direction of this place for support or even just things to read to relate to. But anyway, the more and more I read the more I realized how much the family dynamics described here are SO much my boyfriends family. \\n\\nI\\'ve been thinking for awhile about making a post about my boyfriends nsister(20) and her ridiculous behavior but I could never get my thoughts together but the other day something happened that prompted me to write this. \\n\\nBoyfriend (22M) slept over Sunday night and when we woke up that morning we were just kind of laying around talking about what we were going to do that day. He logged into his bank account app and saw he was overdrawn about $16. He read his account details and saw a purchase for something that he hadn\\'t done, and was done on a day he hadn\\'t used his card at all. So he immediately called the bank and got the account frozen and he\\'s getting a new card sent in the mail. \\n\\nAs soon as he hung up the phone I told him not to tell anyone that he had a new card coming. And lightly hinted at how it could of been someone in his house who did this. He immediately told me he knew it was his sister because she was the only one who could find access to his things like that and the purchase was something my boyfriend has never ever done but she does (it was an App Store purchase). I told him again to not tell anyone (it\\'s none of their business, and I figured if she knew she could grab the new card) and he already had the phone to his ear calling his dad. The conversation went as per usual - his Edad blamed it on him and it was his fault that his sister got her hands on it. And if he has a problem with his sister stealing his money he should tell her himself. It ended with my boyfriend hanging up on him.\\n\\nThis was two days ago, since then his sister has been conveniently avoiding him. She\\'s usually in his business 24 hours a day, but since their dad must have tipped her off she\\'s made herself scarce. \\n\\nI should stop here and say for awhile I\\'ve been struggling with the fact that I\\'ve wanted to tell my boyfriend he\\'s the SG of the family. But I never knew how to really tell him this and share my feelings about his nsister and his parents in case he took it wrong. On Sunday I was so angry for him I just told him flat out that that\\'s what he is. And the way his family treats him isn\\'t the \"way\" you\\'re supposed to be treated. It\\'s absolute bullshit he\\'s supposed to deal with the things he deals with and just accept it. \\n\\nIt absolutely enrages me that his sister feels entitled to do this. And his parents just brushed it off as \"oh well!\" because it happened to him. I also feel so much guilt because my house and family is like a country club compared to his. It\\'s just heartbreaking. We\\'ve both recently gotten new jobs, his significantly better then mine (one he can move up in and honestly keep forever if he wanted) and we\\'ve been saving money in MY savings account since we started working. For unrelated reasons, but I\\'m sure glad it\\'s in my account now. After this fiasco though the time where we have enough money to be on our own cant come fast enough - I know for his mental health he needs to be out of that house. \\n\\nI\\'m sorry if this post seems disjointed or doesn\\'t belong here. I don\\'t have anyone else to really vent this to that understands. Thank you for your support in advance. ',\n",

       " 'Tips, Tricks, and Everything In-Between **1)** Best formations for the vanilla run generally try to amp the 2nd row from the back. Make sure all your buffs overlap on 2-3 characters for the most DPS increase. IMO the best is:  \\n*Back:* Artaxes, Bushwacker/any DPS buffer, Kaine, Princess or Panda  \\n*Middle-Back:* DPSer, DPSer, Jim  \\n*Middle-Front:* Khouri, Sasha  \\n*Front:* Princess or Panda  \\n(Kaine will eventually out DPS people, so feel free to move him into the middle-back row eventually. You suffer a gold decrease, but at high enough levels his DPS will be more than sufficient to make up for the loss!)\\n\\n**2)** When starting out, you will want to open chests immediately. The upsides of getting equipment early on (especially for your first 6 characters) is incredibly important. However, after your first reset you should seriously consider waiting until you hit a \"wall\" before opening them for the gold boosts. When opening a chest, make sure you boost your DPS (take out Bushwacker, add in crusader who gives 15%+ DPS boost) as this affects how much gold the game gives you.\\n\\n**3)** When Nate hits level 50-75, consider putting money into Jim and Kaine. So many people believe he is the strongest source of DPS ever, but Jim and Kaine will grow to be far, far more powerful at a certain breakpoint due to compounding of the x4 bonus. (Around the time Nate hits 50-75). Begin to pump them and the end will be in your sight! (That 10% DPS bonus at level 75 is still great to have, get that when it\\'s comfortable!)\\n\\n**4)** When resetting, make sure you have hit the benchmark for most idols you can receive. The game gives out more idols based on how many crusader levels you have in increments of 500. Don\\'t miss out on an idol because you were 44 levels away from getting that idol!\\n\\n**5)** Check achievements before resetting the world, sometimes just a little bit more of something gives you a big boost on that reset due to an achieved achievement.\\n\\n**6)** Don\\'t feel bad for resetting far before you reach ruby objectives! The time that it takes to get to some of the later objectives without many idols is, quite frankly, ridiculous! I would rather you use your time to reset and gain idols than attempt a long run for 1 jeweled chest.

Putting the Bushwacker in the party instead of a 15% DPS boost member is MORE than worth it, your damage is amplified far over that 15% loss.\\n\\n**9)** Boss fights can generally easily be taken care of with a combination of Simba\\'s Pride immediately, then as the second monster wave walks onto the screen Magnify+Fire Storm. The boss won\\'t be touched by the enhanced Firestorm, but bosses DPS are incredibly low so if you have Khouri healing the front-most character, you will almost surely win if that\\'s the only monster left when it starts hitting you. Further, subbing in King Reginald in place of the Panda for his ability for bossfights is totally awesome if you need that little extra time to finish the monsters before they hit you. \\n\\n**10)** Magnify works with Storm Rider.\\n\\nIf you have your own tips, post them here!

       " 'Maybe the Valk should have TWO utility slots (and more utility abilities) The idea is to get the valkerie to server as a support role, right? Well, if we gave it two utility slots, and more abilities in those slots, that would really give it all sorts of flexibility for support roles. For example:\\n\\n* Equipping both Scout radar for infantry, and another radar with a longer range that only detected vehicles. Tada! AWAKS\\n* Doubling up on proximity repair AND re-supply, to hop in and help out in armored battles.\\n* Infantry resupply for rumble seat occupants, which would refill their ammo AND consumables like AT mines and C4, to allow the valk to lay minefields and bomb tanks and sunderers.\\n* Shield generator like the sunderers deployed shield, combined with smoke grenades. Excellent for hit and run harrassment.\\n* Shield+autorepair would make the valk a friggin flying tank.\\n* Flares that lingered in the air to draw lock-ons from other vehicles, plus IR smoke to give air cover from ground AA.\\n\\nTwo utility slots and a significantly expanded array of defensive and support utilities would make the valkerie a very unique vehicle.

There are a proverb in Russian, which describes primitive football from a team: Бей вперёд - комбинация придёт (literally \"Kick forward - the combination will come\").

       " \"Marine Veteran trying to avoid homelessness(X-POST r/advice) Hi r/Assistance. My best friend suggested that I post here to /r/Advice . I also thought it might be wise to post here. Here it goes.\\n\\nI spent four years in the Marines, got married and had a child. When I got out I decided to go to school for a bachelors of CSE, but after two semesters of failure I couldn't continue. This caused what used to be manageable depression into crippling depression and anxiety. Fortunately, I was able to get hired at AT&amp;T installing U-Verse. This required me to move to another city(Columbus, OH). It was totally worth it, 18$ an hour and great benefits had me looking up for the first time in a long time. Halfway through training, my mom went in to have her gullbladder removed and had two strokes and passed away at the age of 47. It was devastating, I was one of seven children, most of us being in our twenties but there was still my eleven and sixteen year old sisters that had a lot of childhood left. My wife and I were unable to do much for them, having moved away and financially unsound. AT&amp;T said they would give me time off to grieve but I'd have to restart training with another class, and I couldn't afford to do that. My mother would have cursed me out if I did, I know she would have told me to stick with the job even if it means not being able to be with family to grieve. \\n\\nAt this point, I had to swallow my emotions and march on. My wife and three year old daughter are alone, in a new city without any support. We got a cheap(785/month) apartment roughly 2000 feet from the AT&amp;T garage. It was great, I walked to work and had no commute expense. We tried to get on top of the major bills. \\n\\nI should have probably mentioned this earlier, but my wife is unable to work at the moment. Her permanent resident card expired and its roughly about 600 dollars to get it renewed and thats even if they approve it considering we let it expire. So this means that she can't work, nor can she travel. Why travel? I met my wife in the philippines and thats where we fell in love and developed a relationship. For the past six months my mother in-law has been suffering from tuberculosis, some crazy staph infections and liver failure. Her husband makes contact with her maybe twice a year and sends her a small budget each month for food and rent. Healthcare in the philippines does not exist in the way it does here. You have to pay huge deposits and pay upfront for any care you receive in the philippines. Not only is it sub-par care, it is extremely expensive. So here I am, my wife in shambles, helpless because I can't do anything but send them every bit of spare money we have so her mother can have a little bit of care. I can't send my wife home to see her in case she passes soon, I can't afford to get her proper healthcare...Life sucks, because we barely have enough to break even at this point. We try to stay positive, she actively looks for under the table work and finds things from time to time. The dollar store has become our favorite place(and my daughters). \\n\\nFast forward to July 18th, My two week paid vacation starts the on the 23rd. I never thought I'd be a part of a layoff. Not when they tell us every day that we're getting busier and busier. No severance, I'm not even allowed to take my vacation. The Union can't do much for me.\\n\\nSo I hit the streets(and the internet) on the job hunt, I build a few different resumes for a few of my specialties(logistics, IT, management, and customer service). I apply to Uber and Lyft, hoping I can just get some cash flowing in sooner than later. Lyft denies my application and Uber denies it due to the age of my vehicle. Fuck. I don't hear anything back from anyone. Its coming up on August 1st, and I've probably submitted my resume to over 50 legitimate positions. Everytime I follow up I'm given the runaround or I'm told that the position has been filled/I don't meet qualifications. Rent is due on the 1st, I had about a months worth of living saved up but not enough to cover rent, all of the smaller bills and food/gas expenses.\\n\\nOn august 6th I get an email from a recruiter at a company I was unfamiliar with, they had found my resume on Indeed.com and they liked it and wanted me to do a phone \\ninterview. The interview went great, they thought I'd be a great fit and wanted to bring me in to meet the team/face to face interview. At this point I'm trying to workout something with the landlord but I can't give him anything certain and understandably, theres nothing he can do. \\n\\nInterview was scheduled for yesterday, August 14th. On my way to the interview, a telecommunications company recuiter calls me and surprisingly, offers me a job over the phone. Its installing cable, subcontracting work...Not the best gig, but definitely do-able and it will pay the bills. So I have a meeting next friday to sit down with them \\nand discuss things further. The interview? It went incredible, I loved them and I'm pretty sure they liked me and it felt really good. They said they're making offers next \\nweek and I should hear from them at the latest August 22nd. \\n\\nThis morning I'm notified that they plan to evict me and I need to leave the premises within three days or they will certainly process eviction. FUCK! I'm doing everything I \\ncan, I have no idea what to do. I need to pay 1100$ to cease the eviction process and get my account current. Plus a 245$ lawyer fee because they already filed with the attorney. \\n\\nI'm SO close to getting a great job. This job is salaried at 50k, great benefits, monday-friday and I really enjoy what I'd be doing with the company. In the brewery district in Columbus. A dream come true! Worst case scenario, I install cable for this telecom company. The problem is, neither of these jobs will provide me with the capability to stay in our apartment. I'm losing my hair and my sanity trying to avoid this catastrophe.\\n\\nReddit, what do I do?\\n\\nTLDR: I had a rough transition out of the Marines into school, lost my mother, forced to take a job in a different city requiring relocation. On the road to catching up and \\nbecoming stable---Surprise layoff occurs, sending my wife, daughter and I into a messy situation that is certain to end in homelessness. Upside? One great job opportunity and one fallback job if the first one doesnt workout. Landlord can't offer me any type of help/extension, today he served me papers notifying me they plan to evict me. I owe nearly 1400$ to keep my apartment and avoid homelessness. Reddit, what do I do?\\n\\nEDIT: Someone told me to make a gofundme page(I'll remove it if thats not allowed) \\nhttp://www.gofundme.com/d2d8es\\n\\nEDIT 2: I'm not sure why I am being downvoted, if you feel compelled to downvote, please express as to why in the comment section. \",\n",

On a summers day you can\\'t ignore the smell of pristinely kept grass, and the sound of children laughing and playing, is music to anybody\\'s ears. It\\'s a lovely place, a popular place, and really makes London look like a great city.\\n\\nAt night, Hyde Park isn\\'t as great. The sounds of insects and rustling trees is somewhat ominous, to say the least. It closes to the public at midnight, however it\\'s not hard to spend the night there, as the security aren\\'t too sharp. Me, and a few colleagues stayed full nights there, scaring ourselves with lame horror stories, and it was great. It\\'s been about a year since we last did that.\\n\\nIt was 2011. My friends pulled out of a night at the park, they had other \\'plans\\'. I was a little angered that they hadn\\'t let me know sooner, I received a text message when on the journey there. The phone made me jump, as it vibrated and made a very irritating beeping sound. It was a Thursday night, so there weren\\'t many partiers and the train was virtually empty. The \\'evening standard\\' fell off the seat next to me, and a man from the other side of the carriage walked up to me, looked at me, looked down, and took the newspaper back to his seat. He wore a blue bandana, and, my generous guess at his age came to around 50.\\n\\nBy that point, I had decided to spend the night alone in Hyde Park. The homeless do it all the time, I thought to myself. I was obviously misinformed because by the time the gates closed, and the security retracted, I couldn\\'t see anyone in the park. Maybe they just hid better than me? I sat there, played snake on my phone, and thought about sleep.\\n\\nI\\'m not, or wasn\\'t, the type of person to get creeped out by tiny coincidences, or creepy objects. So I didn\\'t react when I saw a pushchair in the middle of a pathway. It was in a pristine condition, it was neat, and had a pouch containing milk and nappies underneath it. I approached it, with little caution, and saw the baby, smiling, mouth open, no teeth, directly at me. I thought it maybe lost, so reached down carefully and moved a small tuft of hair from in front of the child\\'s eyes. Of course, as this is /r/nosleep, I\\'m not going to hide from you that that baby had white eyes. Rolled up into it\\'s head. That baby, was dead. \\n\\n\"I\\'m glad you came.\" A voice from behind me spoke deeply, and in a croaky british accent.\\n\\n\"What the fuck is this?\" I laughed, not because anything was funny, but out of sheer horror. I maintained my horrified glance towards the baby, as the voice from behind me continued.\\n\\n\"The evening standard is a nice newspaper. Yet your evening, will be far from standard.\"\\n\\nI then turned around. The balaclava was the first thing I saw, and I recognised him from the train. I stepped back quickly, almost tripping over and falling on the pushchair.\\n\\n\"I\\'m gonna call the police. Fucking hell. You, you\\'ve...\" I cried.\\n\\n\"Please close your mouth and listen to me, young man\" The man began, \"Listen to me. You\\'ll be one of many fathers of this child, I\\'ve loved him for a month now, but he takes up far too much of my time. I don\\'t want him, you see. I never really did, but I had to take him. Now it\\'s your turn to look after him, feed him, keep him alive. You don\\'t want a dead baby on your hands do you?\"\\n\\n\"He\\'s already dead, you,\" I exclaimed, but I was quickly interrupted.\\n\\n\"Oh he is far from dead. Let\\'s just say, he\\'s different. He still needs milk, and some, soft solids. He needs nappy changing, although nappies don\\'t soak up blood too well. All you have to remember, is that he\\'s yours, until someone else touches him, and then it becomes their baby. It\\'s that simple.\"\\n\\n\"Can\\'t I just leave him?\"\\n\\n\"It doesn\\'t work like that once you\\'ve touched him, unlike most children, this one won\\'t get lost from his daddy,\" he smiled, and began walking away.\\n\\nI would have followed him, but I was too busy running in the opposite direction, away from the pushchair. Security quickly stopped me, and I spent a night in the police station.\\n\\nThis was enough to put me in a state of depression and despair, in my first night back at my house. It was 1am, and I had had no sleep yet. I heard a subtle creaking from the bottom of my bed, looked up, and saw that my wardrobe door had swung open. It surprisingly didn\\'t phase me, I got out of bed, closed it, and lay back down. Eyes wide open.\\n\\nI couldn\\'t get that smile out of my head. The smile on the child\\'s mouth. The tiny little mouth. And the white eyes. I heard the creek again, looked towards the end of my bed, and cried. I didn\\'t even have the energy to scream. \\n\\nThe baby stood at the end of my bed, legs straight, body rigid. Babies don\\'t stand up, I thought, and that second, his legs buckled underneath him, his bright smile still intact, and he fell off of the bed, his head striking the ground with a hollow thud, and for the first time, I heard the baby cry. \\n\\nI flashed back to Hyde Park:\\n\\n\"Unlike most children, this one won\\'t get lost from his daddy.\"\\n\\nSequel: [Evening Standard 2: Kidnap](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/105eba/evening_standard_2_kidnap/)\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

Everything is stored in a big, old warehouse, which is divided up so that we can have \\'coolrooms\\' for storing the very expensive selections. My job involves picking orders in the warehouse to be sent out to customers around town. So, I spend my days scooting around on a pallet mover, putting together mixed pallets which wait overnight to be sent by truck in the morning. \\n\\nHowever, one of our biggest customers complained that their orders of coolroom stock have been heating up overnight. These guys are a substantial percentage of our bottom line, so of course my boss has to jump through hoops for them.

Then I heard it.\\n\\nTAP.\\n\\nIt came from the wall, behind a big stack of pallets. The wall was one of the divisions between the coolroom and the rest of the warehouse, so I went through the roller door to check it out.

       " 'TIFU by trying to do a push-up. I was never any kind of athletic guy to begin with; I ate how I pleased, which wasn\\'t extremely gluttonous, but not healthy either. So recently, as I decided that I wanted to try a Relationship^TM, I knew that I would first need to get to know myself a bit better and try to improve myself at the same time. \\n\\nI moved to a new apartment two months ago, and a month ago I finally pulled the trigger on a membership to the gym across the street. I\\'m following a moderately aggressive approach of between 30 mind and 1.5 hours 4x a week, including at least 20 total minutes of solid cardio. Oddly, I haven\\'t lost weight yet, but I have been getting stronger. \\n\\nIt\\'s worth noting that despite the gains, I have been completely neglecting my abs. My sides ache at the mere thought of an ab workout, and I generally ache for days after. \\n\\nFinal note: I have been experiencing back pain upon exiting my car, but I chalked it up to the car being new to me.\\n\\nSo I did a nice arm workout at the gym last night, and I decided that between that and chest exercises, I was probably going to be able to do a push-up, which I hadn\\'t been able to do since the 7th grade. I lowered myself to the ground in my living room and assumed the position lying stomach-down with my arms out.\\n\\nPerhaps you\\'ve already figured this bit out, but it turns out that you need *some* core strength to do a push-up. I, as it turns out, have none. In an attempt to do what was requested of it, my body decided to take some of the considerable load with my already-tender back muscles. \\n\\nThe result was, frankly, excruciating. A searing, tearing pain exploded through my back and I collapsed, screaming to the floor. I heard the neighbor\\'s door, footsteps running, and my neighbor shouting \"is everything OK?\"\\n\\nThrough tightly clenched teeth and even more clenched back muscles, I managed to grunt through the door that I threw my back out but that I\\'d be ok. She replied sympathetically and asked that I text her in the morning to let her know I\\'m ok (sweet older lady, everybody\\'s grandma, between me and her nephew, she\\'s got this texting thing figured out).\\n\\nAn hour or so later, I released my muscles enough to move a little bit, drag myself up to the counter, and grab some Tylenol. I staggered to the bed and fell asleep. \\n\\nThe next morning, I call a sports therapist that my Dad knows and make an emergency appointment. After texting my neighbor, I arrive, get a loud and slightly disturbing massage, and twist my way back home. \\n\\nMy neighbor is the best, she left me cookies!

       " 'Gave my players an early morally ambiguous situation to see how they\\'d handle it. I\\'m a pretty new DM, though I have played the game since I was a kid. My fiancé and a couple of friends have decided to give the game a try, and I\\'m happy to say that they\\'re quite enjoying it for the most part! That being said, they\\'re all still learning a lot about the game and I\\'ve enjoyed putting them in situations that experienced players might not think twice about. We\\'re playing old school AD&amp;D.\\n\\n&amp;nbsp;\\n\\nAnyway, using some advice that I saw on [this sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/5ugrtb/how_to_start_a_dd_campaign/), I decided to start my group *in medias res*, in this case on a hill overlooking the entrance to a goblin warren. Fortunately, they knew that a large raiding party had vacated the area the night before, so they had some time to wreck the place and get out before the majority of enemies came back.\\n\\nAfter some discussion figuring out how they got there and how they know each other, they decide to take out the four guards with ranged weapons. They kill three but fortunately (for me) the fourth survived and retreated into the warren to alert the other gobbos. With some help from my slightly higher level Magic User/Thief they made it through a couple of rooms, murdering their way through the place until coming up to a weird situation. \\n\\n\\nIn a cavern too large to see all of just from the torches at the entrance, they saw a line of unarmed, small goblins with linked arms. One of the characters (a ranger), who had led the group into the room, tried to talk to them, but only got back replies of \"Fuck you!\" and, \"You led them here,\" and \"Go away! why are you doing this!?\" Before long they worked out that these were all goblin women, and there were likely children in the back of the room. The ranger (run by my fiancé, so I knew how she\\'d react), adamantly refused to slaughter helpless creatures, even if they were goblins. The other characters, a neutral cleric and a fighter, didn\\'t have the same qualms, and before they could rethink their opinion I had my character draw his short swords and start butchering. Had the party been united in not killing them, my character would have held off, but expressed some displeasure. The cleric and fighter joined in, and before long we were well on the way to finishing up the 40 goblin women and 60 children, with the ranger spending the entire time screaming at us to stop and trying to contain the cleric\\'s guard dog, which was a goblin baby killing machine. I had the goblin women just throw themselves at the characters to try and create some kind of barrier between us and their kids. Finally the fighter rethought his willingness to kill them and turned back just in time to fight the goblin leader and his retinue who had just walked in while the last of the kids were mopped up. Later they also had to decide whether they were callous enough to cut off the ears of the children to turn in for the standing bounty of 3 gold/ear. To the horror of the ranger, the guard who collected the bounty was very complimentary about their thoroughness in exterminating the brood. \\n\\n&amp;nbsp;\\n\\nI liked doing this because it gave the group a chance to talk and figure out just what they were willing to do when it came to this type of creature. The other players made good points about the danger of the goblins growing up and murdering innocents, but my fiancé couldn\\'t separate her own revulsion about the act from the probable attitude of a half-elven ranger. It led to the players (and me) learning more about their characters and the world while also giving me great material for later encounters with the Black Fang clan and its affiliated groups, if there are any. I put a juicy map in the cavern that hints towards some future developments, so hopefully they decide to exploit that and not just blow off a good questing opportunity. ',\n",
       " \"No healing PSI run - Update #1 So I made a post last week saying I was going through the game without using any Lifeup or Healing PSI. For the fun of it, since I'm currently at Summers, I thought I'd run through the areas I've been to up to Fourside and detail the change (if any) in difficulty. I'll make another update later once I get a bit further. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n*Onett*\\n\\nOverall, not too bad. Going through with healing items is pretty much the same beginning difficulty that you deal with on a normal run. Key areas:\\n\\n* The Sharks - Grind as normal to a reasonable level and then pray RNG takes you through the Frank fights. I died twice on the fights and beat it on my third try.\\n* Giant Step - First dungeon and the first time you need to come prepared. Rowdy Mice as usual can be tough when you first enter. Luck was needed to level up sufficiently to be able to survive their SMAAASHing hits. I ended up running out of healing items while fighting Titantic Ant and died. Second time through I was fairly well leveled and had a decent amount of items and beat him pretty easily.\\n* Captain Strong fights - Easily the hardest part of the game to date for me. I felt I was at a decent level, but it took some RNG for me to get through it. Not having PSI Lifeup here made the fight so much harder. Hamburgers heal for 50 HP, which is great, except that the Cops hit for around 30 HP if I remember correctly. So you sometimes end up with a net of 20 HP healed, and then if they attack first in the following turn, you end up having the HP healed negated. I want to say it took me about five or six tries to get through it. I actually enjoyed the challenge though.\\n\\n*Twoson*\\n\\n* Everdred - Easy. Maybe RNG could have made the fight harder, I dunno. Only took one try for me.\\n* Peaceful Rest Valley - Along with healing items, you need to carry Cold Remedies to negate the colds you receive from the robotic enemies here. I was very fortunate and was able to get through it on the first try. I brought two cold remedies, and used them both. By the time I got my third cold, I was healed up enough to power my way through to Happy Happy Village. I could easily see this area posing more of a trouble if I would have ran into Territorial Oaks (think I only saw one) and if I received the third cold sooner in the Valley.\\n\\n*Happy Happy Village*\\n\\n* Cultists - By the time you get all of the upgraded equipment you can get (getting the Hard Hat in Peaceful Rest Valley helped I'm sure!), the Cultists don't hit hard enough to be a bother. I found the healing items I brought were more than enough to carry me through.\\n* Mr. Carpainter - Easy fight with the Franklin Badge. Not much else to say.\\n\\nOverall, a fairly easy area.\\n\\n*Lilliput Steps*\\n\\n* Eh, not that bad. You go through the usual phase of carrying Paula through the area to get her leveled up. I actually used Paralysis to cripple Mondo Mole. Shield Alpha came in handy to protect Ness and/or Paula depending on HP level. I died once to MM, but made it through fairly easily enough the second time through with the aforementioned ability. Freeze Alpha of course helps tremendously too.\\n\\n*Threed (Ness &amp; Paula)*\\n\\n* I avoided fights in the streets when possible. At this point, you can really start to dwindle your healing supplies if you get into unneeded fights. The cost for hotels is pretty prohibitive too, so I found myself going back to the shop enough times to stock up on food. \\n\\n*Winters*\\n\\n* No change. Duh. Nope, I didn't grind for the T-Rex bat. I had never done it before and I wasn't going to do it on this run.\\n\\n*Threed (w/ Jeff)*\\n\\n* Boogey Tent - Easy enough. I don't remember anything crazy about him.\\n\\n* Tunnel under Threed - Took me a couple of tries to get through this. Enemies hit pretty hard down there. Brought along some Virals of Serum for the Zombie Dogs and only needed to use one. Mini Barf went down fairly easily once I made it to him.\\n\\n* Grapefruit Falls - Enemies took off for greener pasturers when I came through, I have no idea what happened. I was able to make a straight shot to the cave connecting to Saturn Valley with only one fight. I had even brought money and stocked up with the old man right outside of the tunnel cave, but it turns out I didn't need to.\\n\\n* Belch's Factory - Actually pretty easy. I brought enough healing items, and having the butterfly room meant I was able to go heavy on the PSI attacks. Belch went down in three rounds, and one of them was spent pigging out on Fly Honey. \\n\\n*Desert*\\n\\n* Oooookay, yeah, this place sucked. Bad. I should take a moment to mention that item space is tricky to maneuver around at times. I like to carry all of Jeff's (mostly useless) gadgets, so item space is limited with him. I also carry the Town Map &amp; the For Sale Sign. So, now, I find myself utilizing Escargo Express A LOT. No map in the desert, so the Town Map goes away. Same with any items I don't think I'll need at the time. But I digress back to the original point.\\n\\nWhy does the desert suck? On top of healing items, you need to carry Wet Towels. As in, at least 4 or 5 of them. You also need to carry Vials of Serum, due to the Scorpion enemies that roam around. I died once trying to speed my way through, which meant that I had to hightail it back to Threed to use the Hospital and revive Paula &amp; Jeff. I did NOT explore the desert as I usually like to do. Powered my way to the shack on the east side of the area and that was that.\",\n",

       " 'r/TheRedPill is officially worthless. \"Looks don\\'t matter\" and everyone who says otherwise should kill themselves. So, I\\'ve been having a pretty bad time lately. I feel purposeless without a job, yet also afraid of being a wageslave for the rest of my life. I\\'m depressed all the time, and nothing, not books, not video games, not even the fucking gym seems to cure it. And to be honest, I\\'m quickly running out of Black Pills to throw out. I\\'m considering making a Youtube channel, but honestly, I\\'d probably only see how long I could make MGTOW Anime videos until I got bored.\\n\\nBut just as I thought I was out of steam, fucking TRP decides to declare nuclear war. On the feminists? Nope. The anti-racists? Wrong again. The real thorn in their side is nothing particularly controversial, but that simple, true statement that Looks matter. [And lo and behold...](https://np.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/6rwddq/mod_warning_if_we_see_one_more_thread_bitching/)\\n\\nI get the bitching and moaning part, but why is there a mod\\'s ICBM pointing towards anyone who dares to even discuss how our appearance affects our every interaction? The big \"Final Word\" on Looks hardly addresses the point at all. It spouts purely anecdotal evidence (\"I see ugly guys with hot chicks all the time! Wait, you don\\'t? LIAR!!!), before ultimately screaming for those who disagree with him to literally [kill themselves]( https://np.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/6rtu6h/the_final_word_on_the_looks_debate/). This is the \"positive male identity\" TRP says its trying to create, only supressed by those eviiiiiiiillllll feminists (and not the fact they treat every other sub like garbage). \\n\\nYet at the very same time the Reds stress the importance of grooming and dressing well. And the only thing that makes them more completely infuriated than saying \"Looks matter\" is \"Lifting doesn\\'t matter\". If you want some more \"Alphas\" to tell you to kill yourself, try posting that shit. Looks don\\'t matter...except when it does matter? Why not gain 200 pounds of fat and wear only your finest Trilby...surely your Alpha personality will shine through...\\n\\nThe Truth is TRP knows very well Looks are everything. They will go to the gym, bust their ass and strain their back, sweating gallons, sacrificing previous hobbies to make time, all in the effort to look good. What deeply disturbs them is that race, height, and face are all just as important as muscles and status, yet they can\\'t do shit to change them. It implies the short, autistic, ethnic Incel is mostly doomed to fail, and that their entire philosophy is fundamentally flawed. All of their posturing bullshit about self-improvement only helps already sexually successful men, and if people figured this out, they\\'d discard The Red Pill. The Black Pill is a very existential terror to them, which is why they must seal it off at all costs.\\n\\nBut its fucking true. If you\\'re short enough, you could be a fucking millionaire, and women [still won\\'t be fucking attracted to you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVB3ypWVu14&amp;t=707s). If you\\'re an Asian or Indian piece of genetic trash, you won\\'t be seen as a man by the average woman. How many modern Asian action stars can you name? Who is that Indian boy band heartthrob teenage girls across the globe all want to bang? Answer: there are none, because women don\\'t fucking like them.

They\\'ve voted with their pussies, and, fucking shocker!, it turns out women all love [tall,\\n chiseled white men with Top 20%\\n faces](http://amiuglythrowawayagain.imgur.com/all/). \\n\\nOh, you caught a glimpse of a fat fuck with a model one time out of the corner of your eye? Cool story bro. But when it comes to female\\'s choice of television, movies, and romance novels, that fat fuck is completely gone. Essentially, TRP still believes that their girls are innocent angels. Women aren\\'t shallow, they\\'re not doing anything wrong, its all your fault for not learning game, the solution to all of your life\\'s problems. Most marriages fail or are unhappy not because of women\\'s intense standards for men, practically every man in the country is a pussy. Women swipe right on only 20% of men on Tinder? Looks don\\'t matter bro...they could smell your personality from behind the screen...(where have we heard THIS before?)\\n\\nAnd the funniest thing? We constantly see TRP harp on the importance of being a high testosterone man. Do manly things not because you actually like them, but because women will. Be cocky, take risks, be a little bit of a jerk. All to show that you have high T. Lift weights, change your diet, even inject steroids just to increase your count. All of this will be attractive to women...but when it comes to actual, real, scientifically proven high testosterone markers in [male faces](https://youtu.be/EFnJMPQow7A?t=1015)? Uh...let\\'s not debate about that, m\\'kay? It doesn\\'t matter, so much we will nuke you from orbit if you even mention it.\\n\\nGentlemen, I\\'ve given TRP the benefit of the doubt for the longest fucking time. This is my last straw. I contest that there is no real difference between TRP and The Blue Pill anymore. They\\'re as different as the Republicans and the Democrats. They both blame culture, not biology, for changing the world, they both believe in \"Personality Theory\", and now both show no interest for understanding what drives women to men. Ideology comes first, reality be damned. Because reality doesn\\'t support TRP as much as they\\'d want you to believe: [Here is some more PUA \"success stories\"](https://www.rooshvforum.com/thread-3937.html).\\n\\nLooks matter. Hormones matter. Neurobiology matters. Game and self-improvement won\\'t save everyone.

       " \"Aput's Big Adventure! *Adventure and curiosity* often bloomed in the heart of the youth. With [Aput](https://www.reddit.com/r/CampHalfBloodRP/comments/oocirr/aput_ooa_winters_son/), it thrived. He was curious about everything. *Why are flowers different colours?* Or *What do winged horses eat, and how big are they before they can fly?* Everything was a new discovery. He loved learning from the older campers about monsters, gods, and the great heroic demigods. He hoped one day he’d become a hero.\\n\\nAt this point, the young boy had been at camp for about half a month. This was the longest he’d ever been away from home. Besides staying at his Papa’s house for two nights, he’d never gone so long without his mom. He tried his best to be brave and not miss her too much, but the last few nights he had cried a couple times because of how much he did. He was extremely thankful for *Snowshoe.* Not only was Snowshoe, without question his best friend and partner-in-crime, but he was his constant reminder of home. Snowshoe was a connection to his old life when it was safe to live in the North. The stuffed polar-bear toy was his most prized possession.\\n\\nAput could be found milling around camp, climbing trees, exploring different nooks and what has its. He was *running* out of places to explore. Besides, the cabins which in truth he didn’t really care that much for, the only place left for him to explore was the *forest.* He had been told by several campers, including his big cousin Mack that he was absolutely under no circumstance to enter the woods. This of course, only made the eight-year-old want to explore it that much more.\\n\\nHe knew it was overrun by horrible monsters that wouldn’t think twice about eating him. But he’d killed a *hellhound* all on his own without any help. Using his powers he was able to freeze the creature to death. *Sure…* it was the middle of the summer, and when he last fought one it was wintertime and he was surrounded by snow. But Aput wasn’t worried, he was brave. He was going to be a hero. Besides, he’d only enter the forest for a few minutes, mill around and be back before anyone was the wiser. And come on, it's not like any creatures are actually hanging out on the edge of the forest. They’d be in the centre probably eating each other or something.\\n\\nThe son of Boreas walked around the outer edge of camp for about ten minutes. He slowly made his way, trying his best to avoid drawing attention. He was small and quiet so this really wasn’t that hard of a task. Before he entered a ping would go off in his tummy. *Oh SNOWSHOE!* The boy would visually facepalm himself before rushing back to his cabin to get his partner-in-crime. *Snowshoe* would be SO mad if he found out Aput went exploring without him.\\n\\nAput would activate *ninja-mode.* He had to ensure Mack didn’t see him. He was many things, but a good liar wasn’t one of them. Once inside the cabin, and sure he was alone, he added in some army-crawls, dramatic summersaults, and a horrible cart-wheel as he made his way to the North Wing, and in turn *Snowshoe* who was safely tucked in the boy’s bed. *Mission Accomplished.* Aput had managed to grab his bestie without getting caught.\\n\\nAs the two made their way back to the edge of the forest, it was getting closer to dinner time. Perhaps 4? 4:30 in the late afternoon. It was just dark enough that the edge of the forest cast shadows over the border of the camp. To most, it would seem uninviting, but to the boy, he enjoyed the dark. Living so close to the Arctic Circle, he was used to the long and dark nights. In the middle of winter, his favourite time of year, there might only be two or three hours of daylight *at most*. The rest of the day was tucked under the stars and a thick layer of snow. *Home.*\\n\\nBuilding up his courage, the young boy finally stepped into the woods. He closed his eyes for a moment, wincing. Perhaps he expected to be gobbled up by a dragon the second he entered the woods. This wasn’t the case, which only urged the boy to walk further. Each step, each tree he passed his curiosity grew. What's over there? What's under that rock? *Woah, look at these flowers and mushrooms!* He was determined now. Both him and *Snowshoe* explored each inch.\\n\\nIt was all going fine, until his first encounter.. Almost the size of a small car, curled on its back *dead* was the corpse of the biggest *ant* he had ever seen. His heart pounded in his chest. Was this fear or excitement? The boy sometimes had a hard time telling them apart. He couldn’t push himself to get closer, *Snowshoe* told him it may be dangerous, and whatever was big enough to kill that ant he *didn’t want to meet.* *Yeah, that was enough exploring for the day.*\\n\\nIt had been almost an hour since the boy ventured into the woods. The sun now cast dark, twisting, misleading shadows over the forest floor. His heart sped up a gear, from marching band warm-up to a steady march. The pounding in his ears caused him to panic. The icing on top was that he was now lost. He was too distracted with what was behind the next tree, or under the rock, he forgot to pay attention to where he came from.\\n\\n*Ahoooooooooooo!!* The sound pierced the woods. It sent shivers up his spine and being the son of Winter, that was a feat in itself. The young boy was, unfortunately, familiar with that horrible sound. Did his father do something to the god of the *hellhound?* Was that even a thing? Whatever, or whoever was in charge of these beasts must have really hated Aput, because they always, *always* seemed to track him down.\\n\\nIt wasn’t his first time facing one of these beasts. He could take it. He would - *Ahoooo!* The sound was closer, and before he could think again - *Ahooo!* But, this call came from his left, the other his right. His heart sank. There was no chance in Olympus the boy could handle both. Then directly ahead, a third cry cut through the woods. Three beasts were now howling. Without a second thought, he turned on his heels and ran as fast as he could in the opposite direction. Jumping over tree roots, climbing over rocks and ducking under branches, the boy had never run so fast and hard in his life. Finally making his way into a clearing he slowed down to a jog. He was running out of gas and energy.\\n\\nClutching onto *Snowshoe,* the boy did his best to catch his breath. Jumping over a creek, he slowed to a walk. The clearing was pretty big, one could fit at least three cabins in here comfortably. He wasn’t sure where he was, or where he had to go to get back to camp, but something in his gut told him to keep walking the way he was going. The sun had almost completely disappeared from above, the tall trees concealing the sun away. As he made it to the edge of the clearing a blood-curdling *Ahoooo* would silence the chirping birds, almost stopping his heart from fear. Slowly the boy would turn towards the sound. On the other side of the clearing, three hungry hellhounds stood, their ruby eyes staring the boy down. His body would seize up. Alone, a hellhound wasn’t that scary, but as a pack they were horrifying. The creatures slowly crept towards him. Their heads low to the ground, letting out a deep gut growl. The creatures were still far enough away that the boy might be able to outrun them if he moved. With a force of will, he unfroze himself, turning and bolting into the woods. The moment he made it back into the thick, the pack of hellhounds let out another blood-curdling *Ahooo*. He jumped over roots once again, climbed over rocks and ducked branches.\\n\\nThe boy was foolish enough to look behind himself during his sprint. A thick tree root, reached out, swiping the boy's legs from underneath him. *Thudd.* His body hit the earth hard enough to knock the wind out of him. In a gasp, Aput scrambled to catch his breath and his footing. Standing up, he’d break into a run again. *Forward. Faster.* The only words racing through his head. Sweat beat down his face, and his heartbeat faster than it had ever before.\\n\\nThe edge of the forest came into view, he was almost there. *Push.* Just a little further. *Whoosh.* The boy broke through the wall of branches back into the camp. He’d fall to his knees, doing his best to catch his breath. *Silence.* The son of Boreas waited for the spine-chilling call, too afraid to turn and face the woods. Slowly, he willed himself to look. No glowing red eyes, or horrifying call. He had done it. He outran the hellhounds without so much as hurting himself.\\n\\n“Did you see that Snowshoe we did it!” He let out a soft laugh. *Wait.* Snowshoe...It hit Aput like a transport truck on the highway. First, the panic intensified, his heart starting up again. He quickly looked around the area where he had burst out of the woods, the tears starting to stream down his face. His curiosity, his need for adventure had finally cost him a price he couldn’t pay. The eight-year-old looked towards the forest, his vision blurred from the tears filling his eyes. During his escape, when he fell, he had dropped Snowshoe. He’d start to take a few steps towards the woods again. Tears rushing down his face, he did his best to fight back the sobs. Perhaps the boy wasn’t as brave as he thought, or he was too tired and his adrenaline had started to crash but no matter how much he wanted, how much he needed the energy. Aput couldn’t force his legs to move any further. He was a coward who had let down his best friend, his partner-in-crime and his last connection to his mom and home. *Snowshoe*, his stuffed polar bear.\\n\\nFinally, his emotions had gotten the best of him. Falling to his knees the boy let out a wail of pain. He sobbed. His face was red, and his eyes overflowing with tears. He wanted to go home, he wanted his bear and most of all he wanted his mom. As emotions filled the young boy, he became entirely overwhelmed. The temperature around him plummeted. The dew and grass froze in the blink of an eye. The winds around him picked up, collecting the newly frozen shards of grass and dew. In the centre of a micro blizzard he’d sob. The boy let out one final wail of heartache and despair. Just as quickly as it started, the storm died in a matter of seconds. The winds settled, the ice thawing as the temperature rose.\\n\\nAputs vision would go black. The last thing he saw was his mom's face before the young son of Boreas had finally outrun his last reserve of strength, slipping into a deep sleep.\",\n",

       " 'Depressed after finishing the game *Hello the community!*\\n\\nI discoverd and finished the game one week ago, and it still burns. I think I need to express what I feel. Two problems with that :\\n\\n\\\\- I always have troubles to say what I think and feel. I am more a reader / listener than a writer or a person that you listen to.\\n\\n\\\\- I\\'m French, and far from being bilingual (so sorry for my clumsy way of writing).\\n\\n==&gt; #NotAtEase\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n*Background around myself*\\n\\nI\\'m 38 y/o, and depressed for almost 20 years. I\\'m no good at making real friends. I manage to conceal my state of mind (except a natural dark humor) most of the time, so my family and coworkers do not suspect me to have a depression. As I love food (eating it but also to cook it) and movies, it\\'s easy to talk about something and not just being mute all the time.\\n\\nThen, at work, people like me, but in the end, it is only small talking, never any conversation that really keeps me interested in. What I love most is mainly focused around litterature and arts (mostly music: classical, metal, or more fun stuff like kawaii JPop)... and most people don\\'t really care about it, so I generally have to keep all that for myself. It\\'s been years since I couldn\\'t  have a real long and passionate conversation with another human being. I just don\\'t fit.\\n\\nMy marriage is also not quite a success. My wife is more depressed than I am since her mother died, and she doesn\\'t do much to get out of it (she attempted 2 years ago to commit suicide, nearly next to our 1.5 y/o daughter). So I have to handle most of the daily tasks. She sometimes reminds me that she never really has been in love with me, just that I am \\'OK\\' but no more. The worst has been recently, at the beginning of the covid era, when she told me \"if I catch the illness, there\\'s no need to cure me, I don\\'t care about dying\". All I can do is just try to make things easier for her, and carry on.\\n\\nSo, to sum up, I feel generally lonely, even when other people, and never had true friends or true sweet love (the ones before my wife were not outstanding either).\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n*The Game*\\n\\nI generally play only retro-games (from the 90\\'s), but recently I like to try some new games, simple ones because I do not have much spare time to play and I prefer 2D games with drawings instead of 3D realistic ones.\\n\\nThen, I discovered DDLC, along with its warnings. I was also surprised that all reviews were so respectful as to avoid spoiling the story. I was then really curious about it and never thought it could affect me like it has. I can cry with laughter watching \"Happy Tree Friends\", and I also often see serious movies with bad and sad endings : I feel sad at the moment or for the rest of the day, but I\\'m OK as I know it\\'s just a movie. Moreover, we often see warnings that are overrated... so OK, I gave it a try.\\n\\nI assumed it would be something like one of the girls would go maniac and kidnap / butcher every one else... o boy how wrong was I.\\n\\nI really love the first part, it is my first Visual Novel, and I was pleased of the way it was so well written. I enjoyed the time spent with these girls, and found interest reading the poems (though I could not perfectly translate all the words).\\n\\nAt the confession of Sayori, I still thought she was the one that would go maniac, so I did not pay too much attention at the time (I assumed it to be a generic speech, just to explain any gore things that would appear later)... I even did not confess my love to her, eager to rush things because I still thought it would be a \"fun butchery\", in Tarantino\\'s fashion or something like that. However, on the  festival day, before returning to her room I guessed that it was *merely* a suicide history (and again, in a video game, not in real life). So this time I thought it was only a sad ending with a generic scene... and then, wow! Such realistic grimness, this time I turned white.\\n\\nAfter this, I ended the other acts quite well, both the gameplay and neraly constant breaking of the fourth wall making me grin more than being scared.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n*Aftermath*\\n\\nSo during my first run, I only felt bad one time when gaming... but after completing the game, I felt really depressed, empty and more lonely than usual. I thought about it all day long and sleepless nights: the way Sayori confesses and behaves (\"why making friends?\"), a little like I do on my everyday life. It stabbed my mind.\\n\\nAs I also enjoyed my character to share and discuss poetry; being so warmly welcomed; whose opinion matters... it reminded me how apart I am. Among people, I am tolerated but my presence isn\\'t really necessary.\\n\\nIt\\'s been a week, and I still feel like I\\'m a bag of flesh, pitifully carying a dead soul and a bleeding heart. I sometimes feel the need to listen to the OST, like drawned into a black hole.\\n\\nI also listen many cute / kawaii things to cheer me up. But in the end, I feel the same, it\\'s like taking painkillers when ill or injured: it helps to carry on with the symptoms but the cause is still here. I just don\\'t know what to do next, to feel well after all those years of concealed suffering.\\n\\nI needed so much to spit all this out. I cannot do it with my relatives or job mates. I hope that the readers of this long post did not struggle too much with my English. Thank you for those who actually read all this.',\n",

       " \"House Cow Becomes a Woman Out of all the great stories I have about House Cow, this might be the most disgusting one, and the one that sticks out the most in my memory. This particular incident wasn’t very weebish, so rather than posting in r/weeabootales I'm posting in FPS.\\n\\nHouse Cow and I happened to have two teachers that were good friends with each other. Her teacher, Mrs. Pickle (her favorite food was pickles), was teaching a unit about different types of governments. I was in a civics class taught by Miss Green (so named because she had a cute green dress she would wear often). One day, our teachers decided to have a mixed class movie day and watch Monsters Inc in my civics classroom. We had to fill out [this worksheet.](http://iblog.dearbornschools.org/naura/wp-content/uploads/sites/533/2014/03/Monsters_Inc_Economic_Film_Analysis_Questions.pdf)\\n\\nSo Mrs. Pickle's class comes in and the room fills with a familiar odor. But now, along with the greasy, smelly stench we are accustomed to, there is the strong smell of fish. Some boys started joking about tampons and then we all heard a well-known voice.\\n\\n“Um, excuse you! Some of us don't like sexist jokes!”\\n\\n“House Cow, please settle down. We're here to have fun.” Mrs. Pickle reminds her, and the boys are saved.\\n\\nSomeone points out a table full of snacks and House Cow waddles over. Miss Green stops her. “Hold on a sec, House Cow, these aren't free. There are prices in front of every box.”\\n\\nHouse Cow whines for a while before finally forking over a dollar for a candy bar. Some other girl buys some peanut butter crackers for ₵50, and House Cow does what she does best.\\n\\n“How come she doesn't have to pay a dollar??”\\n\\n“Because House Cow, the crackers don't cost a dollar.”\\n\\n“You're just taking my money because I’m fat! You guys are such ableists! I could sue you for this!”\\n\\n“House Cow,” Mrs. Pickle says, and the hambeast is silenced.\\n\\nThe movie starts. The smell gets worse. Mrs. Pickle has brought a bag of pickles and is munching away. Monsters Inc is one of my favorite Disney movies, so I try to focus on it. House Cow suddenly leans over. “Hey Sheep-chan, I think it's coming!!”\\n\\n“What? What's coming??”\\n\\n“The baby!”\\n\\n“What??”\\n\\n“Me and Dolphin's baby! I'm a real woman now....and I'm pregnant! And I think my baby's coming!”\\n\\n“What the fuck, House Cow! You just met him like three months ago!”\\n\\nThe smell is getting stronger. I'm actually starting to believe there's something wrong. Suddenly she screams loud enough that Miss Green jumps. “House Cow! What's wrong??”\\n\\nHouse Cow jumps up, too-short skirt riding up. “MY BABY'S COMING!!”\\n\\nBefore anyone can do anything, she runs out of the room. Some of the boys laugh and the teachers look very confused. “She's pregnant?” Mrs. Pickle asks, and I tell her that I truly doubt it.\\n\\nJust then there's another scream, but not from House Cow. It's from a girl who was sitting nearby. She points in terror at House Cow's seat and we crowd around to see what's wrong.\\n\\nThere was a huge glob of period blood right in the middle of it.\\n\\nTLDR: House Cow makes cherries\",\n",

Also, when playing Sunset Overdrive, there is a HUGE drop in FPS.  The game still has the input lag, and becomes quite unplayable as the game chugs along.  On top of all that, the Blu-Ray player does the same thing when playing Blu Ray discs.  The weird lighting is present in all movies, and in addition to that, there are occasional frame skips.  It's not a smooth experience at all.\\n\\nThe weird input lag also happens on my Wii U when connected to the TV, so I don't think my Xbox is the issue.\\n\\nI'm looking up more information online, but I'd really appreciate it if anyone more knowledgeable than I could help me out.\\n\\nThanks for reading!\",\n",

       " 'After completing the book Quiet, here is what I have taken from it. I feel that a majority of the world could progress in a better fashion if we just took the time to understand the concepts of individualization and psychology. The ability to think outside of oneself is detrimental to their development and relation to the world. After all, how can you understand something unless you have something else to relate it to? Most would have a hard time understanding a concept that has never been introduced to them.\\n\\nSo here is what I took from this:\\n\\n* People are wired differently: Some for action, some for reflection.\\n\\n* NEITHER of these types is better than or superior to the other. There is a harmony to this world where things are needed to keep each other in balance, e.g. Yin &amp; Yang.\\n\\n* It is important to overcome yourself to become your true self. Sure, we all may want our time to be alone and recharge, but if you never push your comfort zone, how are you going to mentally evolve or make connections with the outside world?\\n\\n* Not everybody will understand what being introverted is, but the more that you stay quiet about it when presented with an opportunity to explain it, the longer that our type of personalities and reservations will be considered \"suspicious\" or related to serial killers/psychopaths. I\\'m not saying to run out and tell everyone you meet, but rather those that are close to you. If they care for you as you care for them, they will be accepting of this revelation and will try to work with you.\\n\\n* If you have an introverted child, do *not* try to stifle their personality. When I was younger, I was put on all types of medication for what was thought to be ADHD and I always hated it because I felt like a different person on it and couldn\\'t really think. Allow your kid to be who they are and respect that, but also know when to put your foot down as a parent and push the child when it is needed.\\n\\n* Evaluate the worth and interest level of anything that you attempt to share with an extroverted person. As introverts, we love the pursuit of knowledge and enjoy sharing it with others, but just as I\\'m sure most of us do not care about the tabloids, they may not care about the newest scientific discovery.\\n\\n* Try your hardest to be receptive to change and new information. There is no point in remaining completely rigid within your beliefs, and we must evolve in order to make it in an extroverts world.\\n\\n* If you are in a relationship with an extroverted person, it is imperative that you both find a middle-ground and that you understand each other. However, if this does not seem to be possible, it is important that you do not force something to work if you cannot find balance.\\n\\nThese are just a few observations that I have made after reading the book and wanted to share them with you guys. I appreciate any feedback that you may want to give me.',\n",

       " \"Yakisoba Yakisoba 焼きそば (nontraditional)\\n\\n:: Please note :: This is just my version of yakisoba. Other yakisoba sauce variations include ingredients like honey, sugar, chili paste, oil, etc. But, cooking is about you and what you enjoy, follow the rules, don't follow the rules, it's up to you. The important thing is that it tastes good to you. Thank you everyone for the amazing feedback!     \\n\\n\\n**YAKISOBA SAUCE INGREDIENTS:**\\n\\n* 5 tbsp of Worcestershire sauce \\n* 5 tsp of oyster sauce\\n* 5 tsp of ketchup\\n* 2 ½  tbsp of soy sauce\\n\\n**INGREDIENTS:**\\n\\n* 3 shiitake mushrooms sliced\\n* ½ onion sliced\\n* 1 carrot cut into matchsticks\\n* 2 green onions cut into small pieces\\n* 4 cabbage leaves cut into small pieces\\n* ½ lb of thinly sliced pork belly cut into 4” pieces\\n* 1-2 tbsp of oil\\n* ~ 8 Tbsp. yakisoba sauce \\n* 1 pkg Yakisoba Noodles\\n\\n**TOPPINGS (optional):**\\n\\n* Pickled red ginger for garnish\\n\\n**DIRECTIONS:**\\n\\n1. To make the yakisoba sauce, combine all the ingredients in a small bowl and whisk together. Adjust the sauce according to your liking. If you would like your sauce to be sweeter, add up to 2 tbsp of sugar. Set sauce aside while you prep the veggies and meat.\\n\\n2. Slice the shiitake mushrooms and the onion. Cut the carrot into matchsticks. Chop the green onion and the cabbage into smaller pieces. \\n\\n3. Cut the thinly sliced pork belly into 4” long pieces.\\n\\n3. If you have a griddle pan, awesome. If not, heat oil on medium high heat in a large pan or wok. Cook the pork belly until there is no more pink visible.\\n\\n4. Add the onion, carrot and cabbage and cook until slightly softened. \\n\\n5. Add the mushrooms and scallions and stir fry until mushrooms are cooked. \\n \\n6. Add 4 tbsp of yakisoba sauce and stir so the sauce coats everything.\\n\\n7. While the veggies continue to cook, soak your yakisoba noodles in hot water for just a few seconds. Swish around to make sure noodles aren't sticking to each other. Drain and set aside. \\n\\n8. Lower the pan heat to medium. Add the drained yakisoba noodles. Stir to evenly distribute. \\n\\n9. Add 4 more tbsp of yakisoba sauce. Depending on the amount of ingredients, adjust the amount of sauce. Mix all together. Keep stirring and make sure not to burn the bottom of the pan.\\n\\n10. Serve on a plate and garnish with pickled ginger. Serve immediately.\\n\\n**TIPS:**\\n\\nUse more or less vegetables based on your own preference. I like more veggies. Same goes with the yakisoba noodles.\\n\\nCook the veggies to your preferred doneness. I like when the carrots and onions still have a bit of a snap to it. \\n\\nMost yakisoba sauces have sugar. I think the ketchup is sweet enough without the added sugar.\\n\\nQuick video demo here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI90OgNENsw&amp;list=UUYU6_VO4C-WAwXIZ9IHh_2w\",\n",

       " 'Transgender student (please read details!) First, I\\'m not actually a teacher. I\\'m an aide, but I work very closely with the teacher I\\'m under - I\\'ll call her my boss. \\n\\nToday was the first day of school (high school), and as my boss was going through roll, we found that there is a transgender student (ftm) in one of our classes. My boss typically asks if students have a preferred nickname, etc, so this is how it came up. The student shared his preferred name and pronouns and seemed fairly comfortable with the topic. My boss said that until things are changed in the official school records, she will continue to call the student by his given name and pronouns. The student seemed mostly okay with this, we moved on quickly, and it wasn\\'t a huge deal. I understand and respect the way my boss handled it, and I think it\\'s a very safe, fair approach. I think she strategically \"blamed\" it on policies, but it\\'s also safe to say that she\\'s uncomfortable with the subject as well.\\n\\nHowever. I\\'d like to call the student by his preferred name and pronouns. I don\\'t often teach in front of the whole classroom, I mostly work with small groups of students or individually, so I don\\'t think it would seem blatantly obvious that I was doing something different. But I\\'m concerned about contradicting my boss. She is older and very experienced, I am pretty young and this is just my second year. \\n\\nTo be honest, I\\'m not super comfortable or knowledgeable about transgender issues, and I have no interest in delving into a deep conversation with the student about it. I was mostly thinking how difficult of a day it must be for this kid, to have to explain it over and over, etc., and it\\'s really not a big deal for me to ease some of his discomfort by calling him what he prefers. I myself am gay (and not out to my students), so I know how difficult and awkward this stuff can be sometimes.\\n\\nI definitely don\\'t want to argue with my boss, nor am I out to change her mind or opinions, but I do want us to coexist peacefully on this issue, if that makes sense. I think I\\'m on the right track here, but does anyone have any advice on how to manage the situation? Thanks.\\n\\nEDIT: I am also curious about how official my boss\\' statement is. I don\\'t want to get in trouble for calling a student what he prefers (although that would be absurd and so wrong). I just want to be prepared in case something like that does happen.\\n\\nEDIT 2: In case anyone was curious and wanted an update - I went and talked to my administration. They are backing me 100%, which is a relief. I will be able to use the student\\'s preferred name and pronouns, and hopefully create a more positive, accepting environment for him. My admin will talk to my boss sometime soon, so I\\'m still hoping there\\'s not \"fallout\" or that my boss feels like I\\'ve tattled on her, but I feel better knowing I\\'ve done the right thing. Thanks for everyone\\'s helpful advice and support.',\n",

       " 'Reddit, please help. Is this alcoholism? 19 y/o female here. Home from college for the summer, shortly returning. Ever since I came home for the summer I noticed that my mom buys a new 12 pack of Bud Light almost every night after work, and drinks about 8 of them. When I first came home in May, I would innocently sneak a couple and not say anything. When she started to notice, she told me she didn\\'t mind and I should drink them with her instead of by myself, because \"drinking by yourself leads to problems\". \\n\\nI began drinking openly with my mother pretty frequently, to the point where she\\'d buy extra because she knew I\\'d be joining her. We\\'d have great conversations and have bonded this summer more than ever. Soon, her and my stepdad started going out of their way when I asked for my own beer or liquor, and they\\'d buy it for me. I quickly became a main provider for my friends as well.\\n\\nHere\\'s the catch: I\\'ve become so used to drinking almost every night, that without it I feel like I can\\'t sleep, I can\\'t think straight, I\\'m moody. I drink during the day now, whatever I can find. August has been the worst of it, though. My personality has changed, it doesn\\'t mix well with my new anti-depressant, I feel irritable and anxious without a drink, and I\\'ve gained 15 lbs. When I\\'m with my friends I\\'m uninterested until I\\'ve found a way to drink alcohol, and the personality difference is immeasurable.\\n\\nI\\'m coming to Reddit with this issue because I\\'m too embarrassed to confide in anyone I know. Even my therapist has no idea, and I\\'d hate to tell her now because she\\'s always praised me for not being a typical partying college kid. I\\'m afraid, as addiction runs in both sides of my family.\\n\\nPlease, any advice is very welcomed and appreciated. I love how alcohol makes me feel, but I know I can\\'t continue this so early in life. If this isn\\'t the right subreddit to be posting in, I\\'d really appreciate a more appropriate sub suggestion. Please UPVOTE so I can hear as much advice as possible. I know I need anything I can get.',\n",

       " 'Tinder in Taiwan A recent reply on a recent post inspired me to conduct a little unofficial research on Tinder here in Taiwan. Maybe you\\'ll find it pointless, and maybe it is, but I\\'m hoping it will spark a little discussion (that isn\\'t related to China or Coronavirus). This is just for fun.\\n\\nI set my search parameters to 50km (of Taichung) and browsed 200 profiles for this \"research\". Keep in mind that I only searched for girls. Please feel free to do your own research and post it as a reply.Here is what I found:\\n\\n6% of profiles with names like \"Aghjgsf\" or \"Adohsdg\", whose tag line or workplace was always \"sisiserer\". I must assume that these are some sort of bot, as all of these profiles contain only one picture of a typically \"hot\" Taiwanese girl with photoshop-enhanced breasts.\\n\\n3% of profiles had some level of English in their \"about me\". Usually just a single line of text about how they like to watch movie.\\n\\n12% of profiles had pictures of themselves (presumably), but didn\\'t show their face in any of their pictures. (two such profiles then amusingly claimed \"NO ONS\"... like, who is going to propose casual sex with a person before they\\'ve ever seen their face? but maybe Taiwanese dudes are hornier than I had assumed)\\n\\n7% of profiles had all of their selfies taken from the same angle, with the same hand attempting to make their chin look smaller\\n\\n57% of profiles had no \"about me\" at all.\\n\\n13% of profiles had at least one picture where they were modeling some kind of \"luxury\" watch.\\n\\n4% of profiles contained no pictures of humans at all.\\n\\nOf the profiles that included pictures of themselves, 80% contained *only* pictures of themselves (meaning no pictures with other people). This is quite different from your average profile in North America.\\n\\nIn general, I get the sense that Taiwanese women don\\'t understand that Tinder is a dating app. Maybe I\\'m wrong.\\n\\nI would love to see a breakdown of 200 men\\'s Tinder profiles in Taiwan (or I might do it myself if I get bored).',\n",
